# **Under the Sacred Tree: Harvest Rhythms, Groves, and Sky-Time across Bhāratavarṣa**

*Ekam sat viprā bahudhā vadanti* — “Truth is one; sages speak of it in many ways.”  
 In India’s cultural geography, those many ways gather under a tree, within a grove, beside a stone.

## **Introduction: a grammar you can walk**

This chapter argues that India’s ritual life is encoded in a **walkable grammar**: **trees** and **groves** act as living shrines; **stones** remember; **sky-time** and **harvest-time** set the cadence; **song and drum** bind memory to place. From the **sthāla-vṛkṣa** (temple “place-tree”) still anchoring Tamil shrines, to **Law Kyntang/Law Lyngdoh** sacred forests among Khasi–Jaintia, to **devrai/devarakāḍu** god-groves across the Western Ghats, to **Sarna/Jaher** (sal-groves) in the eastern Adivāsi belt, to **ringing-rock** petroglyph hills in Karnataka and **megalith gardens** in Meghalaya — a resilient pattern recurs. Communities fix **ritual time** to **sky-time** (solstices, *saṅkrānti*), **monsoon clocks**, and **agro-phenology** (blossom, first-fruits, threshing), and then inscribe those cycles in **places**: tree, grove, stone, tank, and procession route.^1

Our method correlates **ethnography** (living rites and oral genres), **archaeology** (petroglyphs, megaliths, settlement sequences), **ecology** (phenology, hydrology), and **textual memory** (*Itihāsa*, *Purāṇa*, regional literature). We flag claims with a **confidence** mark — High (H), Medium (M), Low (L) — based on convergence, dating resolution, and continuity chains.^2 We avoid over-astronomizing village calendars (many are **sidereal** or **phenological**, not exact equinox rites) and resist leaping from prehistoric stones to modern clans without intermediate anchors.^3

## **I. The tree before the temple: *sthāla-vṛkṣa* as archive of place \[H\]**

Across the old *kṣetras* of the Tamil country — **Śrīraṅgam** (bookmark), **Kāñcī**, **Madurai**, **Tiruvannāmalai** — a living axis still organizes ritual space: the **sthāla-vṛkṣa**, the “place-tree.” In many sites the tree precedes masonry: a shade-canopy where vow, vow-thread, and pouring of water (*abhiṣeka*) were performed before walls rose.^4 Ritual iconography internalizes this arboreal centrality: **Dakṣiṇāmūrti** (Śiva as south-facing teacher) seated beneath **vaṭa** (banyan), the tri-foliate **bilva** (Aegle marmelos) keying Śaiva worship, **pippala** (Ficus religiosa) entwined with meditation and vow, **nīm** (Azadirachta indica) with healing and protective liminality.^5

Two consequences follow.

1. **Temporal anchoring.** Vows, fast-breaks, and parish-level calendars return to the same tree. Blossoming or leaf-flush can even serve as **phenological cues** for starting or ending observances (Makar/Pongal sequences often carry such micro-timings). \[H\]

2. **Spatial federating.** The tree orchestrates **tanks** (*tīrtha*), **channels**, and **processional arcs**; sacred botany spills outward into **groves** at village margins. In several regions, a **single massive banyan** gradually becomes a **grove** by accretion, with taboos regulating lopping, grazing, and water use. \[M\]

**Bookmark — Śrīraṅgam (to be expanded later):** the precinct’s **tree–tank–procession** triad and temple botany (notably **Punnai**, *Calophyllum inophyllum*, where attested) will be treated as an exemplar of “tree-first, temple-later,” aligning ritual calendars with hydrology.^6

**Confidence:** H for the institution’s ubiquity and integration in plan/liturgy; M for site-by-site botanical specifics pending local temple records.

---

## **II. Sacred groves as institutions: Khasi–Jaintia, Western Ghats, Chotanagpur \[H/M\]**

### **1\) Law Kyntang / Law Lyngdoh (Khasi–Jaintia, Meghalaya) \[H\]**

Among Khasi–Jaintia, **sacred forests** (*Law Kyntang*, *Law Lyngdoh*) are governed by **priestly lineages** and village councils. They are **no-take** zones under customary law; breaches entail ritual atonement and social sanction.^7 Studies repeatedly show these groves as **old-growth refugia**, buffering springs and biodiversity. **Megalithic fields** — notably **Nartiang** (bookmark) — often lie contiguous with groves, binding **memory stones** (hero, clan, law) to **living woodland** (deity and ancestor rites). \[H\]

### **2\) *Devrai* / *Devarakāḍu* (Western Ghats) \[H\]**

From Konkan–Maharashtra to **Kodagu (Coorg)**, god-groves persist under diverse names (*devrai*, *devarakāḍu*, *kāvu*). Their logic mirrors Khasi practice: **customary law**, **ritual closure** to extraction, periodic **festival entry** by hereditary or elected custodians, and strong links to **water security** (spring heads, percolation) and **pollinator habitat**. Rites affirm **first-fruits** discipline (deity/ancestor receive offerings before people feast). \[H\]^8

### **3\) *Sarna/Jaher* (sal-groves) in the eastern Adivāsi belt \[M→H\]**

Among **Munda**, **Ho**, **Santal**, **Oraon** and neighbors across Jharkhand–Odisha–Bengal, **sal** (*śāl*, Shorea robusta) dominates **Sarna/Jaher** groves — the ritual village forest where **spring rites** such as **Sarhul** (arrival of sal blossom) and **Bāha** take place. In **Karam** (Munda-speaking regions), a branch of **karam** (Adina cordifolia) is installed, sung over, and returned to the earth — a **didactic drama** of forest–field reciprocity.^9 Ethnographic literature is robust; cross-dating with archaeology is growing but uneven. \[M→H\]

**Continuity thread:** groves stabilize **ritual sovereignty** over landscape; stones externalize memory beside living woodlands; ecology (water/pollinators) supplies secular reasons for sacred protection. \[H\]

---

## **III. Sky-time and harvest: solar turnings, monsoon clocks, and first-fruits \[H/M\]**

India’s festival map is a **calendar keyed to sky and crop**. Two solar **turnings** and two ecological **pivots** dominate.

### **A. Solar turnings**

* **Makar Saṅkrānti / Pongal (mid-January)** — Solar transit into **Makara** anchors winter harvest thanksgiving across the subcontinent. In Tamil country, **Pongal** unfolds as **Bhogi** (household renewal and hearth-cleansing), **Sūrya Pongal** (solar thanksgiving), **Maatu Pongal** (cattle honoring), and **Kāṇum Pongal** (kin/landscape visits) — braiding **cosmos, cattle, kitchen, and kin**.^10 Across the north-west, **Lohri** burns away the old; in Gujarat **Uttarāyaṇa** kites lift the skyward theme.^11 \[H\]

* **Mesha Saṅkrānti (mid-April)** clusters — **Vishu** (Kerala), **Bohag Bihu** (Assam), **Puthāṇḍu** (Tamil New Year), **Pohela Boishakh** (Bengal). Shared motifs: **auspicious first-sight** (*kani*), **plough/fire** rites, **seed/leaf** symbolism, and market/community resets. \[H\]

**Caution:** While popular presentations claim **equinox alignments**, many practices are **sidereal solar** or **agro-phenological** rather than astronomically exact. We keep claims modest and local-calendar led. \[M\]^12

### **B. Ecological pivots**

* **First-fruits rites** (late monsoon–autumn): **Nuākhāi** (western Odisha) offers the **first cooked rice** to village deity/ancestor; only thereafter may families eat the season’s grain. In the Garo hills, **Wāngalā** (“hundred drums”) thanks **Misi-Saljong** (Sun) post-harvest with synchronized **drum-dance** and communal feasting.^13 \[H\]

* **Forest-linked spring rites:** **Sarhul** (sal blossoms; central-eastern belt) and **Karam** (karam branch ceremony) enact each year’s **forest–field contract** with dance, call-and-response song, and regulated revelry. **Sohrai** (Santal/Goda/Ho zones) celebrates cattle, threshing floors, and wall paintings with rice-slurry pigments.^14 \[H\]

### **C. Riverine and cattle time**

* **Bohag/Rongali–Kongali–Bhogali Bihu** (Assam) tracks a **triad** of agricultural stages; **Magh Bhogali** marks feasting and **meji** bonfires; **Rongali** (spring) foregrounds plough, cattle washing, and riverbank play.^15 \[H\]

* **Mātū Pongal** and **Sohrai** center the **cattle** as kin-economy, emphasizing their role in plough, manure, and mobility. \[H\]

**Continuity thread:** *Saṅkrānti* regimes articulate a **shared civilizational clock**; local **phenology** (blossom, ripening, monsoon lull) refines **village-level time**. The two fuse in sacred places — tree and grove — where vows, offerings, and songs recur predictably. \[H\]

---

## **IV. Stones that sing, stones that stand: petroglyphs, acoustics, megaliths \[H/M\]**

### **1\) Kupgal–Sanganakallu (Ballari, Karnataka): performance landscapes \[H/M\]**

On the **Kupgal** and **Sanganakallu** hill complex, thousands of **Neolithic petroglyphs** co-occur with **acoustic “rock gongs”** — basalt faces that ring when struck. Archaeological work documents **pecked panels** (cattle, humans, nets, abstract forms), **use-wear** on resonant surfaces, **sound-mapping** of ledges, and **view-shed** to pastoral corridors. The cumulative case: hilltops served as **performance locales** for **seasonal gatherings**, where sound, stone, and social life converged.^16 Ethnographic bridges to modern rituals are inferential (no living Kupgal liturgy), but India-wide harvest drums (e.g., **Wāngalā**), **gōṭul** (Gond youth houses with dance instruction), and **mela** circuits suggest an enduring **sound–season** grammar. \[H for sequence; M for bridging\]

### **2\) Edakkal (Wayanad, Kerala): corridor palimpsest \[M\]**

**Edakkal** sits on a pass between Malanād and the Mysore plateau. Engravings span periods (anthropomorphs, animals, sign-like forms), indicating repeated visitation. Later **ballads** and **folk pilgrimages** “read” the shelter as repository; still, direct linkage to today’s village calendars is unproven. As a **pass palimpsest**, Edakkal shows how **stone archives** arise in mobile landscapes. \[M\]

### **3\) Nartiang (West Jaintia Hills, Meghalaya): megalith garden by the grove \[H\]**

**Nartiang** arrays **menhirs** and **dolmens** in curated clusters next to **sacred groves**. Oral histories remember **Mar Phalyngki** and royal summer stays; clan stones articulate **law and lineage**. Dimensional typologies, patterned groupings, and continuing feasts/rites yield a rare case where **megalithic practice** remains a living **social grammar**. \[H\]

**Continuity thread:** Stones act as **signal, stage, and statute** — they **sound** (Kupgal), **speak** (inscriptions later), or **stand** (megaliths) to store and project memory beside groves. \[H\]

---

## **V. The sacred tree lexicon: species, rites, ecologies \[H/M\]**

### **Banyan / *vaṭa* (Ficus benghalensis) \[H\]**

Aerial roots create **living cloisters**; shade moderates tank-microclimates. Philosophically linked to **Dakṣiṇāmūrti** (gnosis under a tree). Banyans often mark **council grounds**; in many regions, village boundary banyans receive **oath-rituals**. \[H\]^17

### **Peepal / *pippala* (Ficus religiosa) \[H\]**

Conjoined with meditation and **vāta-pitta-kapha** healing logics; pollinator and frugivore keystone in settlement ecology. Frequently encircled by railing or low wall with **lamp niches**, underscoring nocturnal vow prayers. \[H\]

### **Bilva (Aegle marmelos) \[H\]**

Tri-foliate leaves key to Śaiva worship; fruit used in fasting-breaking and seasonal offerings. Bilva groves protect **understory moisture** and provide **leaf/twig** ritual economy. \[H\]

### **Nīm (Azadirachta indica) \[H\]**

Linked to cooling/healing; ceremonial **nīm-neem** smudges for fumigation; thresholds for **protective liminality**. \[H\]

### **Śamī / Khejri (Prosopis cineraria) \[H\]**

Desert keystone in Rajasthan/Gujarat: fodder, pod, nitrogen-fixing canopy. **Śamī-pūjā** at **Daśahrā**, and **Bishnoi** conservation ethics make it a classic **ecology–ritual** case. \[H\]^18

### **Aśoka (Saraca asoca) \[M/H\]**

Court-garden and grove tree; flowers in late winter–spring; linked to fertility motifs. \[M/H\]

### **Sal / *śāl* (Shorea robusta) \[H\]**

Backbone of **Sarna/Jaher** groves; **Sarhul** explicitly tied to sal blossom as calendar cue; sal canopy influences ground moisture and mushroom flushes — details that local ritual scripts often notice without naming. \[H\]

### **Punnai (Calophyllum inophyllum) \[M/H\]**

Coastal temple tree of the south-west littoral; oil used in medicine and maritime uses (waterproofing). In certain Kaveri-delta shrines (bookmark Srirangam), **punnai** has ritual presence; to be documented site-specifically. \[M/H\]

**Continuity thread:** sacred trees are **ritual media** *and* **ecological infrastructure** — shade, water retention, fodder, pollinator support — hence their stubborn survival against land-use churn. \[H\]

---

## **VI. Sacred hydrology: tanks, serpent-banks, and grove-water circuits \[H/M\]**

Temple tanks (*tīrtha*, *kulam*, *pushkariṇī*) anchor **processions, vow-dips, and monsoon storage**. On many south Indian sites the **tree–tank–shrine** triad is explicit: pradakṣiṇā paths encircle both tree and water, and **float festivals** translate calendrical peaks into **watery theater**. **Nāga** (serpent) shrines often line **tank embankments**; offerings to **Nāga-Devatā** ritualize embankment care and canal hygiene.^19 In the north-east, Khasi–Jaintia groves protect **springheads**, while in the Ghats, **devrai** protect rills feeding terraced paddy. \[H/M\]

**Continuity thread:** hydrology is not an add-on but **structured sacredness**. Where the grove is revered, **water clarity** and **seasonal baseflow** often persist longer — a point noticed (and ritualized) long before hydrology was a science. \[H\]

---

## **VII. Eastern Adivāsi calendrics: Sarhul, Karam, Sohrai, Nuākhāi \[H\]**

### **Sarhul (sal-blossom rite) \[H\]**

In **Ranchi plateau** and surrounds, **Sarhul** marks sal blossoms’ arrival (roughly spring). The **Pāhān** (village priest) leads offerings in **Sarna/Jaher**; the **blossom** is paraded, then feasting ensues only after deity/ancestor portions. Ethical songs praise **forest restraint**, kin reciprocity, and water.^20 \[H\]

### **Karam (tree-branch rite) \[H/M\]**

A **karam** branch is installed in the village, sung over through the night by women’s circles, and ceremonially returned to earth. Branch-borne **morality fables** teach diligence and respect for crops and kin. \[H/M\]

### **Sohrai (cattle–harvest festival) \[H\]**

Coinciding with threshing, **Sohrai** honors **cattle** (washing, painting horns), the **threshing floor**, and **wall-paintings** in rice-slurry and natural pigments; motifs include **grain, vines, fish, peacocks**. \[H\]

### **Nuākhāi (first-fruits) \[H\]**

In western Odisha and border tracts, new rice (**nua**) is ritually offered before household consumption; ancestral plates are fed first, embedding **memory economy** into everyday eating.^21 \[H\]

**Continuity thread:** the eastern belt’s rites put **forest–field reciprocity** and **ancestor priority** at the center; the grove provides both ethics and acoustics (song, drum). \[H\]

---

## **VIII. Central Indian heartlands: Gond, Bhil, gōṭul, and Bastar Dussehra \[H/M\]**

### **Gond lifeworld: the gōṭul and seasonal training \[M/H\]**

The **gōṭul** (youth house) is a social school where dance, song, clan law, and seasonal discipline are taught. While **gōṭul** is not itself a grove, its pedagogy orbits **groves**, **fields**, and **water**; dance-steps, drum patterns, and call-and-response songs are **calendrical mnemonics**. \[M/H\]

### **Bastar: Dussehra as moving sacred geography \[H/M\]**

**Bastar Dussehra** (not a Ramāyaṇa pageant but a region-long ritual complex) moves through **forests, rivers, and villages** over weeks, assembling deities on a **chariot** that is itself a wood-ritual, and consecrating **forest-products**. It dramatizes **polity as procession**, with grove-stops and water crossings patterning the route. \[H/M\]^22

### **Bhil–Aravalli corridor: stones, groves, and rain \[M/H\]**

In Bhil country across Rajasthan–MP–Gujarat, origin/hero stones and **rain-rites** at hill shrines connect **monsoon anxiety** to **stone-and-grove** ethics. Nearby prehistoric sites (e.g., **Daraki-Chattān** cupules) cue **deep time**; we do not conflate them with present clans but read **family resemblances** in hill-edge ritual geographies. \[M/H\]

**Continuity thread:** from **gōṭul** pedagogy to **processional polity**, central India articulates **law through movement**, with groves and stones as checkpoints in the seasonal school of the land. \[H/M\]

---

## **IX. North-East sound and stone: Wangala, Lungterok, and monolith law \[H/M\]**

### **Garo Wāngalā (“hundred drums”) \[H\]**

Post-harvest thanksgiving to **Misi-Saljong** (Sun) concentrates **drumming ensembles**, dance in **crescent formations**, and field-to-village transitions. Ritual rhythm locks in steps and stories — a sonic calendar of land and sky. \[H\]

### **Ao Lungterok (“six stones”) \[M\]**

Ao Naga origin memory of emergence from **six stones** at **Lungterok** intersects with archaeology only partially (scatters of shells/conches in highland sites imply old **coastal reach** or **trade**, not a full route). Useful as **identity-charter**, approached with declared caution for chronology. \[M\]

### **Khasi–Jaintia law at megaliths \[H\]**

Clan oaths, inheritance, and funerary memory at **menhirs** and **dolmens** show **stone as statute**; adjacency to groves preserves both water and law.^23 \[H\]

**Continuity thread:** in the hills, **drum** sets time; **stone** codifies law; **grove** guarantees life. \[H\]

---

## **X. Littoral edges and island memory: kavus, punnai, and Andaman voices \[M/H\]**

### **Malabar kāvu and Theyyam \[H/M\]**

In the Malabar, **kāvu** (sacred groves) harbor serpent shrines, **yakṣi** deities, and **Theyyam** performance. Ritual circuits here braid **tree, mask, drum, and story**; several kavus hold **water-eyes** (springs) and **old canopy**. \[H/M\]

### **Punnai, sea-temples, and boat memory \[M/H\]**

Coastal temples often preserve **punnai** (*Calophyllum inophyllum*); its oil and timber entered **boat-making** and **waterproofing**. Coastal shrines encode **storm memory** and **tide etiquette**, from offerings at **sea-mouths** to taboos on cutting **strand trees**. \[M/H\]

### **Andaman oral archives (Great Andamanese) \[B/D\]**

The **Great Andamanese** corpus (e.g., **Phertajido** “born from bamboo”) preserves a hunter-gatherer cosmology largely independent of mainland scriptural worlds; it contains **hazard memory** and **resource mapping** in story form.^24 No geological or archaeological cross-anchor ties specific motifs to datable events; its value is **cultural continuity**, not chronology. \[B for documentation; D for historical tying\]

**Continuity thread:** along India’s ocean rim, **groves and trees** face the **monsoon and cyclone**, and ritual calendars often have **littoral adjustments** (fishing closures, sea-offerings) woven into inland harvest rhythms. \[M/H\]

---

## **XI. Text and stratum: when Itihāsa meets layers \[M/H\]**

**Hastināpura**’s **flood stratum** (near the Painted Grey Ware horizon) is a classic case where a **literary memory** (flood and relocation in *Mahābhārata* narratives) seems to touch **sediment**. Our posture remains **model-based**: we outline readings (e.g., “lived memory of flood → later epic motif”) without asserting hard identity.^25 \[M/H\] Elsewhere (*Rāmāyaṇa*’s groves: **Aśoka-vatikā**, **Pañcavaṭī**), we treat **tree-grove topos** as **civilizational repertoire** rather than place-pins, noting how **hermitage** and **forest** shape narrative ethics.^26 \[M\]

**Continuity thread:** texts often preserve **motif-memory** (grove, flood, exile in forests) rather than map-memory; archaeology can sometimes supply anchors, but we mark the seam. \[M/H\]

---

## **XII. Threats, stewardship, and living law \[H\]**

**Mining and quarrying** threaten Khasi–Jaintia groves; **plantations** and lot-sizing nibble at **devrai/devarakāḍu**; **linear infrastructure** severs hydrological threads. Yet **customary law**, **community forest rights**, and **temple botany** movements show **living stewardship**: taboo, oath, and festival can still **outperform paperwork** where state capacity is thin.^27

**Continuity thread:** the grammar endures where **law remains lived** — song lines as rules, groves as courts, stones as records, trees as teachers. \[H\]

---

## **Conclusion: roots that remember**

Under banyan and peepal, in sal-grove hush, upon ringing-rock ledges, beside menhirs, India’s peoples have long **kept time together** — sky-time with solar turnings and monsoon breaths; earth-time with sowing and harvest; memory-time with stones and songs. The **temple tree** shows how architecture **grew around** arboreal sanctity; **sacred groves** show law and ecology **entangled**; **megaliths** show memory **made literal**; **petroglyph hills** show performance **cut into stone**; **harvest festivals** show **kitchen, cattle, and cosmos** in a single rite. If we ask how deep and far the roots of **Bhāratīya sabhyatā** and **janajāti** praxis go, the answer is not one date but a **durable grammar** — planted, sounded, and stood up in the landscape.

**Bookmarks for later deep-dives**  
 **\[A\] Śrīraṅgam:** tree–tank–procession system; *sthala-purāṇa* motifs; precinct botany (punnai).  
 **\[B\] Nartiang:** megalith typology; grove adjacency; royal overlays; contemporary custodianship.

---

## **Notes (commentary footnotes)**

1. **Walking the grammar.** We foreground places that a reader can physically traverse — tree, grove, tank, stone — rather than begin from texts; the aim is to let **grounded forms** lead theory (India-centric method).

2. **Confidence rubric.** We tag major assertions H/M/L based on **multi-source convergence**, **dating resolution**, and **continuity chain** from past to present; this mirrors the project’s book-wide rubric for comparability.

3. **Astronomy caution.** *Saṅkrānti* observance is often **sidereal** (solar ingress by Indian ephemerides) and/or practical (post-harvest); claims of equinox precision are popular but not uniformly borne out by local calendars.

4. **Tree before wall.** Multiple south-Indian temple studies record **tree-shrine to masonry** sequences; we keep site-specific claims cautious until archival/epigraphic checks per temple are appended in the apparatus.

5. **Sacred botany.** Banyan, peepal, bilva, and nīm saturate precinct iconography, vows, and medicine; species lists per precinct vary (apparatus to include temple-botany surveys).

6. **Śrīraṅgam.** The punnai tradition and tank–procession choreography will be documented with temple records and field notes; we reserve specifics to a dedicated sidebar.

7. **Khasi–Jaintia law.** Sacred forests under *Lyngdoh* or village council guardianship are well documented; grove–megalith contiguity at Nartiang shows rite and law sharing the same landscape.

8. **Devrai/devarakāḍu.** Community-guarded forests in the Ghats are tied to springs and first-fruits rites; Kodagu’s *devarakāḍu* governance provides a strong comparative frame.

9. **Sarna/Jaher rites.** **Sarhul**, **Bāha**, **Karam** ritual scripts emphasize blossom, branch, and ethical reciprocity; musical structures encode law and memory.

10. **Pongal suite.** Four-day Tamil sequence braids **household renewal**, **solar thanksgiving**, **cattle honor**, and **landscape visitation**; crop–cattle ethic is central.

11. **Lohri/Uttarāyaṇa.** North-western bonfires and Gujarati kite festivals index **winter turning**; we treat them as regional articulations of the same solar hinge.

12. **Mesha cluster.** **Vishu**, **Bohag Bihu**, **Puthāṇḍu**, **Pohela Boishakh** focus on first-sight, plough, and market resets — a civilizational spring refresh.

13. **Wāngalā/Nuākhāi.** Drumming ensembles and first-fruits discipline exemplify the **sound–grain** nexus; deity/ancestor precedence is ethically explicit.

14. **Sohrai painting.** Rice-slurry pigments on walls (vine, fish, peacock motifs) archive seasonal joy and cattle reverence.

15. **Bihu triad.** Rongali (spring), Kongali (austerity), Bhogali (feasting) track agricultural stages; riverbanks and cattle washings index ecology.

16. **Kupgal.** Petroglyphs \+ rock-gong acoustics \+ view-sheds argue performance landscapes; we avoid asserting direct survival in any single modern rite, using **analogy** not identity.

17. **Banyan councils.** Village banyans as oath-grounds and council shade are attested across regions; their root-arcades produce social space.

18. **Śamī-pūjā & Bishnoi.** Desert tree as ritual–ecology nexus; Bishnoi ethical codes protect khejri; Daśahrā śamī rites link to victory/renewal narratives.

19. **Nāga banks.** Serpent shrines act as **embankment guardians** in many southern sites; offerings ritually maintain water edges.

20. **Sarhul ethics.** Songs and toasts narrate restraint, kin reciprocity, and water respect; blossom is cue and symbol.

21. **Nuākhāi ethics.** First-fruits are owed to deity/ancestor; the living eat after the dead — memory is literally baked into the first pot.

22. **Bastar Dussehra.** Not an epic drama but a **region-scale procession polity**; the chariot is a wood-ritual, forests are actors.

23. **Stone statute.** Khasi–Jaintia megaliths embody law and lineage; ritual speech acts at stones assert legitimacy.

24. **Andaman voices.** Great Andamanese myths (e.g., Phertajido) show bamboo-birth, sky-ascent, hazard lore; unmatched to stratum, yet vital as cultural archive (we grade D for historical anchoring, B for documentation).

25. **Hastināpura layer.** Flood stratum near PGW horizon is a widely discussed correlation; we present the model and its debates, no forced identity.

26. **Itihāsa groves.** *Rāmāyaṇa* groves (*Aśoka-vatikā*, *Pañcavaṭī*) are read here as **motif libraries**; place-claims remain cautious.

27. **Stewardship today.** Customary law, community forest rights, and temple-botany initiatives sustain living grammar; the book’s apparatus will document cases rather than generalize.

## **Commentary Footnotes (sample, apparatus to be expanded in the book)**

1. *Why trees first?* Across peninsular and eastern India, multiple precincts and village memories attest that **tree-shrines pre-date masonry**, with later enclosures built around earlier vow practices. We keep local specifics cautious until site records are appended. \[H\]

2. *Confidence tags.* High \= multi-disciplinary convergence (ethnography \+ ecology \+ archaeology/text). Medium \= good in one domain, partial in others. Low \= suggestive. This mirrors the project-wide rubric. \[H\]

3. *Peepal–Neem “marriage”.* Ritual pairing acts as a folk balancing of “hot/cool” qualities; ecological upshot is a **composite shade \+ insecticidal** micro-habitat. \[M/H\]

4. *Desert śamī ethics.* Khejri’s fodder value and dune-binding make ritual protection materially rational; the **Bishnoi** code exemplifies law embedded in worship. \[H\]

5. *Sarna–Karam.* Song texts, performance sequences, and the **first-fruits rule** anchor a living moral economy; archaeological cross-dating is improving but still uneven regionally. \[H/M\]

Project-style, transliteration, and footnoting follow **HistorySite3** conventions; validation/bibliography expansion will be run at compile.
