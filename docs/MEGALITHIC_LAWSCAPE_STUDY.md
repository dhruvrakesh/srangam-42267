# Megalithic Lawscape Study Guide

## Nartiang Typology System

### Menhir Classification
- **Ki Moo Shynrang** (Male Stones): Upright monoliths
  - Height range: 2m - 8.5m
  - Typically tapering towards top
  - Placement: Boundary markers, oath-stones, memorial sites

- **Ki Moo Kynthai** (Female Stones): Dolmens with capstones
  - Capstone dimensions: 1-3m diameter
  - Support stones: 3-5 uprights
  - Function: Burial/ossuary, clan markers

### Spatial Analysis

#### Grove Adjacency Metrics
**Mawphlang Case Study:**
- Grove area: 80+ hectares
- Menhir clusters: 3 primary nodes
- Springhead proximity: <100m for 80% of stones
- Downstream beneficiaries: 10+ villages

**Ecological Measurements:**
- Water retention: 40% higher than non-grove areas
- Biodiversity: 120+ tree species, 70+ bird species
- Carbon storage: 250 tons/hectare (vs. 80 in degraded forest)

## Customary Law Documentation

### Law Kyntang / Law Lyngdoh Rules

#### Access Protocols:
1. No fruit harvesting within grove boundaries
2. Deadwood collection allowed only after springhead offerings
3. Hunting prohibited except ritual occasions
4. Entry requires barefoot passage near shrines

#### Enforcement Mechanisms:
- **Social sanctions:** Clan ostracism for violations
- **Ritual penalties:** Purification offerings
- **Economic consequences:** Loss of water access for downstream families
- **Hybrid governance:** Traditional councils + state forest officials

### Taboo System Ecology

| Taboo Rule | Ecological Function | Confidence |
|------------|---------------------|------------|
| No fruit removal | Seed dispersal, wildlife nutrition | H |
| Deadwood protocols | Nutrient cycling, microhabitat | H |
| Hunting closure | Population stability | M/H |
| Barefoot entry | Soil compaction reduction | M |

## Comparative Lawscapes

### Regional Variants:

#### 1. Khasi-Jaintia (Meghalaya)
- **Markers:** Menhirs + dolmens + springheads
- **Grove type:** Law Kyntang (sacred forest)
- **Legal basis:** Customary law (Niamtre tradition)
- **Scale:** 80-200 hectares typical

#### 2. Kodagu Devrai (Karnataka)
- **Markers:** Hero stones + tree shrines
- **Grove type:** Devara kadu (god's forest)
- **Legal basis:** Clan councils + state recognition
- **Scale:** 5-50 hectares typical

#### 3. Malabar Kāvu (Kerala)
- **Markers:** Serpent stones + tree platforms
- **Grove type:** Sarpa kāvu (serpent grove)
- **Legal basis:** Temple trusts + family holdings
- **Scale:** 0.5-10 hectares typical

## Research Protocol

### Site Mapping:
1. GPS coordinates for all megaliths (±2m accuracy)
2. Height, width, material documentation
3. Grove boundary delineation
4. Springhead locations and flow measurement

### Ecological Measurement:
1. Vegetation transects (50m × 5m standard)
2. Tree species inventory (DBH >10cm)
3. Bird point counts (10-minute intervals)
4. Soil samples (carbon/moisture, 30cm depth)
5. Water flow rates (dry/wet season)
