## **Abstract**

This article proposes “graphic transmission” as a longue-durée framework for studying the production and consumption of comics and graphic novels. Beginning with prehistoric cave and rock art—e.g., the Bhimbetka rock shelters and global petroglyph traditions—through temple ceiling programs in South Asia and the Sistine Chapel to contemporary print and mobile formats, I track how images have repeatedly served as **information systems** that coordinate memory, ritual, ethics, and social imagination. Bringing this historical arc into conversation with core concepts from comics theory—Groensteen’s spatio-topia, panel/syntagm, arthrology, hyperframe, margins, site, insert (inset), and gutter; Cohn’s visual language and cognition; and Eisner’s “sequential art”—I show how the modern graphic novel formalizes long-standing cultural practices of arranging images to guide attention and inference (Eisner; Groensteen; Cohn).

The second half reframes adaptation studies for this global, multimodal century. Against fidelity-based orthodoxies that privilege literature-to-film, I synthesize Hutcheon’s intersemiotic “re-mediation,” Elleström’s intermediality, Andrew’s warnings about intangible “tone/values,” McFarlane’s split between story and enunciation, and Sanders’s call for a richer vocabulary of relations (Hutcheon; Elleström; Andrew; McFarlane; Sanders). A case study of *Jane Eyre: The Graphic Novel* (Classical Comics, Quick Text) demonstrates how page architecture (hyperframes, braiding, inset) re-codes Brontë’s narrative into plurivectoral sequences, compressing verbal exposition through painted mise-en-scène, onomatopoeia, thought/speech balloons, and motif work—without reducing complexity (Corzine et al.).

I conclude by situating graphic novels within today’s mobile, image-saturated attention economy and by outlining research directions aligned with the **Journal of Graphic Novels and Comics**: (1) world literatures of comics, including Indian graphic cultures; (2) institutional and creative ecologies of production; (3) accessibility and multiliteracies in pedagogy; and (4) platform-specific aesthetics in the mobile/webtoon era. Across millennia, graphic transmission has remained a civic technology for storing, circulating, and transforming meaning. The modern graphic novel is its most reflexive, teachable, and globally scalable form.

## **1\. Introduction: Aims, Scope, and the Long Arc of Images**

The **Journal of Graphic Novels and Comics** calls for work that understands comics as a mass medium embedded in cultural, institutional, and creative contexts and that takes an international view—including Indian traditions alongside European, Japanese, and other scenes. This article responds by placing the graphic novel within a deep history of **graphic transmission**: from prehistoric walls and rock faces to temple ceilings and modern print pages to the screens we hold in our hands. It argues that the graphic novel systematizes a recurrent social practice—**arranging images so that viewers infer relations across space and time**—and that this practice is an engine for both cultural continuity and innovation.

Two scholarly conversations converge here. The first is **comics form**, where Groensteen supplies a robust vocabulary—panel and syntagm (the basic spatio-temporal unit and its sequential relations), restrained and general **arthrology** (relationships among adjacent and non-adjacent panels), **hyperframes** and **multiframes**, margins, **site** (cartesian and reading-order coordinates), the functional **inset**, and the cognitive and rhetorical **gutter** (Groensteen, *System*; “Spatio-Topia,” in your materials). The second is **adaptation studies**, where graphic novels have often been sidelined by literature-to-film fidelity debates. Hutcheon, Elleström, Andrew, McFarlane, and Sanders provide tools for thinking adaptation as **intersemiotic translation** and **intermedial negotiation** rather than as derivative reduction (Hutcheon; Elleström; Andrew; McFarlane; Sanders).

Bridging these conversations to a global historical arc clarifies how images have long been used to **store knowledge, coordinate ritual, and teach ethics**. From Palaeolithic paintings to temple and church programs to today’s meme streams and webtoons, graphic transmission shapes publics. The modern graphic novel—especially in its pedagogically oriented and globally circulating formats—becomes a privileged site for studying this mass mediation.

## **2\. Graphic Transmission Before Print: From Rock Shelters to Ceiling Programs**

The Bhimbetka rock shelters in central India preserve layered scenes of hunting, dancing, and everyday life painted over millennia; global **petroglyphs** (incised/pecked images on rock) likewise encode local cosmologies, routes, and taboos. While their makers and viewers are separated from us by time and context, these complexes already demonstrate three features we will later see formalized in comics:

1. **Spatial segmentation and repetition.** Rock faces are organically divided; figures cluster in zones; certain motifs repeat—animals, weapons, dance lines—creating visual rhythms that guide the eye.

2. **Sequential inference without syntax.** Viewers infer before/after from overlap, scale, orientation, and gesture—primitive arthrology.

3. **Paratextual embedding.** Images are placed within lived landscapes—caves, shelters, ridge lines—where approach paths and light conditions shape legibility, just as margins and hyperframes will in print.

Temple ceilings in Jain and Hindu architectures (from, for instance, the intricately carved marble programs at Dilwara to painted ceiling cycles in various regional temples) organize **narrative, cosmology, and ethical instruction** across coffered segments and radiating rings; programs are designed for initiated reading but reward general viewing. In the European context, the Sistine Chapel ceiling (frescoed in the early sixteenth century) is a paradigmatic **sequential program**: a grand hyperframe subdivided into panels whose iconographic relations—creation scenes, sibyls/prophets, ancestors—invite both restrained and general arthrological traversal. In all of these settings, **graphic transmission** binds images to ritualized **routes of attention** (circumambulation, liturgical choreography, processions). The long history is not that “comics began in caves,” but that **organizing images to choreograph inference** is an enduring human technique whose modern codification is the graphic novel.

## **3\. Sequential Art as a Mass Medium**

With print culture, this technique becomes democratized and routinized. Newspaper strips, pamphlets, and later book-length “graphic novels” transform ritualized viewing into **repeatable, portable sequences**. Eisner famously condensed this into “sequential art”—art that deploys **arranged images to convey narrative or information**—and underscored how panelization, economy of line, and staging co-produce clarity and affect (Eisner, *Comics & Sequential Art*; *Graphic Storytelling*). Contemporary multimodality research (Jacobs; Serafini; Leander & Boldt) extends this to literacy: readers navigate text, image, sound (onomatopoeia), typographic emphasis, and layout as a coordinated **cognitive performance**.

In the Indian context, graphic storytelling has developed along multiple tracks: newspaper strips, educational comics, literary adaptations, and experimental works that dialogue with regional art practices. Globally, as Baetens and Frey argue, the “graphic novel” is less a fixed form than a **convergent label** that collects diverse practices under the book market’s affordances—longer narratives, bookstore shelving, literary review circuits, and academic reception (Baetens and Frey). For a journal attentive to production/consumption, the crucial point is that **institutions**—publishers, curricula, festivals, platforms—shape what counts as “serious” graphic work and who reads it.

## **4\. A Formal Toolkit: Spatio-Topia, Arthrology, Hyperframe, Margins, Site, Inset, Gutter**

To analyze how the graphic novel packages graphic transmission, I draw on the formal vocabulary synthesized in your files:

* **Panel (spatio) & Syntagm (topia).** The panel is the minimal unit; the syntagm is its sequential relation (present/prior/next). Narrative arises as readers assemble **static images \+ dynamic verbal/graphic cues** into temporal sequences (Groensteen, *System of Comics*; “Spatio-Topia,” in your paper “Adaptation to Graphic Novel—Structure and Interrelationships”).

* **Arthrology.** *Restrained* arthrology covers contiguous relations (left-to-right, top-to-bottom); *general* arthrology tracks non-adjacent echoes across pages/chapters—visual rhymes, motif returns, color reprises (Groensteen).

* **Hyperframe / Multiframe.** The **hyperframe** is the page as a governing container; extended to double-spreads or whole books, we get multiple scales of **multiframes**. Designers can use “open” hyperframes, bleed, or borderless layouts to collapse margin/frame distinctions.

* **Margins.** Far from empty, margins carry titles, running heads, chapter notches, and can be activated as a visual field (as Antonio Altarriba suggests). Their **size, content, autonomy**, and **aperture** (continuous vs intermittent border) influence pacing and emphasis.

* **Site.** A panel’s position (cartesian coordinates) encodes both spatial/visual prominence and **temporal ordering**; “reading protocols” can be confirmed or subverted by arrows, trails, or focal vectors.

* **Word balloons & narration boxes.** Balloons are “sound objects within images,” non-diegetic containers of diegetic content; their form (rectangular/elliptical/irregular), line-quality, and color functionalize voice, timbre, and focalization (Smolderen; Groensteen).

* **Inset (incrustation).** An **inclusive** master frame can host inset frames that “zoom,” re-anchor continuity, and manage complex simultaneities; when multiplied, insets perform cinematic rack-focus or split-screen effects.

* **Gutter.** The **space between frames** is not a void but a cognitive hinge. McCloud popularized this as closure; your typology further differentiates **moment-to-moment, action-to-action, subject-to-subject, scene-to-scene, aspect-to-aspect** gutters, each prompting distinct inferential labor (cf. your taxonomy; Serafini’s visual comprehension framework).

Together these tools let us chart **how** graphic novels allocate attention, compress or dilate time, and distribute interpretive labor across readers.

## **5\. Rethinking Adaptation: Beyond Fidelity, Toward Intermedial Negotiation**

Traditional adaptation study often treats the “original” as authoritative and the adaptation as belated and derivative—especially when moving from canonical literature into “popular” media (Hutcheon xiii–xv; Sanders 12–24). Your prior papers critique this orthodoxy and advocate vocabulary that recognizes **epistemological transformation** across media. The theoretical consensus across Hutcheon (re-mediation/intersemiotic translation), Elleström (modalities and intermedial relations), Andrew (limits of “intangible” stylistic transfer), McFarlane (story vs. enunciation), and Sanders (networked relations) is that **meaning is re-encoded through medium-specific affordances** (Hutcheon 16; Elleström, “Modalities”; Andrew 100–01; McFarlane; Sanders).

Graphic novel adaptation therefore is not a “reduction of words” but a **re-articulation of narrative information** through page architecture, drawing, color, typography, and braiding. As your *“Adaptation to Graphic Novel: Structure and Interrelationships”* argues, every choice of panel **form/area/site**, hyperframe aperture, balloon typology, and gutter type participates in **enunciation**—how the story speaks—rather than merely **what** it recounts. The consequence for pedagogy and scholarship is significant: once we analyze **how** graphic novels make meaning, the “fidelity” debate gives way to questions of **design intelligence** and **readerly work**.

## **6\. Case Study: *Jane Eyre: The Graphic Novel* (Classical Comics, Quick Text)**

Your earlier article *“Graphic Novel Adaptations of Canonical Texts”* uses the Classical Comics adaptation (*Quick Text*) of Brontë’s *Jane Eyre* to demonstrate intermedial translation. I build on that analysis to highlight the formal mechanisms of **graphic transmission** at work.

**Compression via Mise-en-Scène and Hyperframe.**  
 Where Brontë’s opening relies on pages of prose to establish household, era, and character dispositions, the adaptation compresses this into a **single hyperframed page**: costumes, architecture (Gateshead Hall), and proxemics lock spatio-temporal cues into the image itself. As you note, the prologue “merely contains two and a half speech bubbles,” because most exposition is **in the paint**—a classic case of **re-mediation** where verbal description is translated into **visual anchoring** (Corzine et al. 8–9; Hutcheon 16).

**Plurivectoral Attention and Reader Agency.**  
 Unlike linear prose, the graphic page invites **plurivectoral traversal**: the eye can drift from architectural establishing shot to the bedside scene and then to Jane’s window. The design uses **restrained arthrology** (L→R sequencing) but rewards **general arthrology** by repeating postures and visual tensions across pages (your account of braiding aligns here). Readers reconstruct the **emotional topography** before parsing the few balloons.

**Onomatopoeia, Thought Balloons, and Focalization.**  
 The scene with the domineering boy and Jane’s defiance turns on **onomatopoeic bursts** and the mixed use of **speech** and **thought** containers. The adaptation taps the medium’s ability to **layer focalization**: third-person context boxes align with an external narrator while **thought bubbles** (or first-person captions, depending on edition) preserve the Bildungsroman’s interiority (Corzine et al. 17–19; see your analysis).

**Inset as Cinematic Zoom.**  
 Several sequences deploy **insets** within inclusive panels to enact a “cinematic zoom”: the master frame sets scene and mood; small insets isolate a hand clenching, a glance deflected, or an object that will braid forward. Time thickens as the eye moves between scales; gutters switch from **action-to-action** to **aspect-to-aspect**, guiding affect and inference (your “Incrustation/Inset” section).

**Margins as Paratextual Memory.**  
 While many adaptations keep margins utilitarian (page numbers, running titles), they can be activated to carry **period typography**, chapter mottos, or color-fields that partition chapters. As your margin taxonomy suggests (size/content/autonomy), even “white” edges are rhythmic devices: narrow margins intensify density; open margins “rest the eye,” altering perceived pace.

**Result: Not Less, but Other.**  
 When a seven-page prose stretch becomes three painted pages, something is lost—Brontë’s long sentences, tonal ironies—but something is also **gained**: **distributed cognition** across image clusters, **ambient world-building** through color and texture, and **synchronous comparison** of characters’ stances. Following McFarlane, this is the difference between **narrative “what”** and **enunciative “how”**: the latter is medium-constitutive and not commensurable one-to-one with prose.

## **7\. Production and Consumption: Institutional and Global Frames**

The journal’s emphasis on **cultural/institutional contexts** invites us to widen the lens beyond close reading. Three production/consumption dynamics matter for graphic transmission today:

**(a) The Educational-Literary Circuit.**  
 Graphic adaptations of canonical texts—*Jane Eyre*, *Moby-Dick*, *Crime and Punishment*, among many others (Sienkiewicz; Mairowitz)—are sustained by **school curricula, exam boards, library procurement, and teacher training**. Jacobs shows how comics sponsor **multimodal literacy**; Serafini elaborates the interpretive strategies readers deploy for **visual-dominant texts**. These institutions incentivize **clarity without condescension**—precisely the design problem adaptation excels at (Jacobs; Serafini).

**(b) The Globalizing Field.**  
 Baetens and Frey underline how the “graphic novel” label travels with the **book market** and institutional legitimation; Berninger et al. frame comics as a **nexus of cultures** linking media industries, disciplines, and international publics. For Indian graphic cultures, this means that local visual idioms (miniature traditions, scroll narratives, temple iconography) can be translated—not as exotic garnish but as **page-level design intelligence**—into contemporary publication formats (Baetens and Frey; Berninger et al.).

**(c) Platform Ecologies.**  
 Layout logics adapt to platforms: stitched pamphlets and hardbacks reward **double-spread rhetorics** (center gutters, bleeds); tablets preserve spreads but alter scale; phones encourage **vertical scroll grammars** with expanded negative space and episodic cadences. Elleström’s intermedial schema is useful here: platform shifts alter **material modalities** (screen/page), **sensory modalities** (haptic/visual), **semiotic modalities** (text/image/audio integration), and **spatiotemporal modalities** (page-by-page vs infinite scroll). The underlying **graphic transmission** persists, but its **enunciation** reconfigures.

## **8\. The Mobile and Information Age: Attention, Multiliteracies, and Design**

We now live in an environment saturated with **short-form, image-forward content**—social feeds, reels, webtoons, infographics. Rather than lament this, comics scholarship can lead with **design literacy**: the very skills readers need for critical navigation are the ones graphic novels train—**tracking motifs, reading gutters, discerning focalization, and parsing the ethics of representation**. Lefebvre reminds us that space is produced; in the mobile age, **screen space** is likewise produced by platform affordances and attention markets (Lefebvre).

For researchers and educators, three practical implications follow:

1. **Teach the page as instrument.** Spreads, hyperframes, and gutters are not decorative; they are **arguments** about causality, time, and agency. Teaching students to “play” the page cultivates transfer skills for data dashboards, newsfeeds, and public-health infographics.

2. **Historicize visual literacy.** From rock shelters to temple/church ceilings to broadsheets to webtoons, graphic transmission has always mediated **authority and access**. Students should learn to ask: **who frames? who is asked to infer? who is left outside the frame?**

3. **Design for accessibility.** Balloon fonts, contrast ratios, captioning of sound effects, tactile/alt-text paratexts, and platform-appropriate pacing are not afterthoughts; they are **ethical commitments** baked into the hyperframe. (Here, Dolmage’s critique of “steep steps” in academic spaces is a useful analogue for editorial design choices; although not the focus of this article, the accessibility insight is germane to production.)

## **9\. Synthesis: Graphic Transmission as Comparative Method**

The argument here—anchored in your prior research—does not collapse premodern visual programs into “proto-comics,” nor does it reduce literary adaptation to “picture books.” Instead, it advances **graphic transmission** as a comparative method for the journal’s international, institutional remit:

* **Historically**, it foregrounds the persistence of **image sequences** as civic technologies that **store and circulate** meaning—from Bhimbetka and temple ceilings to the Sistine Chapel to mass print to mobile screens.

* **Formally**, it leverages Groensteen’s and Cohn’s toolkits to specify how modern graphic novels translate that persistence into **page-level design intelligence** (panel/syntagm, arthrology, hyperframe, margins, site, inset, gutter; visual language and cognition).

* **Methodologically**, it relocates adaptation debates onto **intermedial negotiation** (Hutcheon; Elleström; Andrew; McFarlane; Sanders).

* **Institutionally**, it situates graphic novels within **production/consumption ecologies** crucial to a Scopus-indexed mass medium journal: curriculum pipelines, global markets, and platform infrastructures (Baetens & Frey; Berninger et al.).

## **10\. Conclusion: Research Programs for a Mass-Medium Future**

Graphic novels sit at the intersection of millennia of image practices and the newest attention markets. They are **not** the belated stepchild of prose fiction; they are the **most reflexive and teachable instance** of graphic transmission—a civic technology now scaling globally. For journals attentive to production and consumption in cultural, institutional, and creative contexts, four concrete research programs recommend themselves:

1. **Global genealogies of layout.** Comparative studies that trace how regional visual traditions (e.g., South Asian temple programs, scroll formats) are re-encoded as page architectures in contemporary books and apps.

2. **Adaptation as design intelligence.** Analyses that detail how specific hyperframe strategies (aperture, margins, insets) and gutter typologies carry narrative/ethical load in adaptations of canonical and regional texts.

3. **Pedagogy and multiliteracies.** Classroom research linking comics page skills to broader civic literacies (data visualization, public information, media ethics).

4. **Platform-aware aesthetics.** Studies of how infinite scroll, haptic gestures, and vertical formatting evolve arthrology, braiding, and motif work.

In the longue durée, **graphic transmission** is a social contract: creators compose sequences that teach us how to see, remember, and imagine together. The graphic novel translates that contract into book and screen—portable, teachable, and open to the world.
