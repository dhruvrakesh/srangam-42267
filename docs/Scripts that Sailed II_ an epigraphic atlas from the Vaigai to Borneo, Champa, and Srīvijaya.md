# **Scripts that Sailed II: an epigraphic atlas from the Vaigai to Borneo, Champa, and Srīvijaya**

**Overture (method, 700 words)**  
 **Claim.** *Scripts travel on ships; language is older than letters; Sanskrit is first an oral discipline that takes new scriptual vessels abroad.* In South and Southeast Asia, this triad is visible with unusual clarity: recited Sanskrit (and Prakrit/Tamil) precedes the lithic record; then, at ports and pilgrim nodes, speech stabilises into **letters**—on yūpa‑posts in Borneo, on an early Sanskrit stele near Nha Trang, and in Old‑Malay royal prose at Palembang. The epigraphic trail is thin but diagnostic; the maritime archaeology is richer but often undated; the literary memory is deep yet non‑probative. We therefore bind these **different registers** under two house rules:

1. **A–D confidence rubric.**  
    **A** \= dated inscription in context (primary edition/photograph/estampage); **B** \= palaeographic convergence across multiple sites/time‑bands; **C** \= textual echo (śāstra/Sangam) that correlates with A or B; **D** \= plausible cultural memory without material anchor. We badge every subsection.

2. **Paired‑evidence rule.**  
    No major claim stands on a single leg: inscriptions pair with port layers or prosopography; textual passages pair with epigraphy; palaeography pairs with dated strata. In practice, this flows into your **Theme → Article → Sourcebook → Map** loop, with a pin card per inscription and a QA row recording edition, photograph, ductus notes, and date discipline.

**Operational standards.** We privilege **primary editions** and **institutional corpora** (EFEO’s *Corpus of the Inscriptions of Campā*; de Casparis’s *Prasasti Indonesia II*; museum catalogues; ANU Press syntheses), and we cite **recent Southeast‑Asian scholarship** (Griffiths; Acri; Guy) alongside Indian epigraphic authorities (Mahadevan; Salomon). Your multilingual HUD and glossary coverage targets (≥99% on protected terms) constrain phrasing and sidebars.

**Baseline distinctions.** **Language ≠ script.** Sanskrit is not “Devanāgarī only.” In our corridor it appears in **Southern Brahmī/“Pallava”** and **Grantha‑type** ducti; Tamil appears in Tamil‑Brāhmī and later in Grantha contexts; Old Malay adopts a **Pallava‑type** syllabary and a Sanskrit lexis. Salomon’s framework and Pollock’s *Sanskrit Cosmopolis* remain serviceable scaffolds, but we keep the decolonized corrective: letterforms in Java/Champa are **local technologies** adapted from South Indian prototypes, not passive copies. [Archive.org+1](https://dn790009.ca.archive.org/0/items/IndianEpigraphy/Indian%20Epigraphy.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**What counts as proof?** Not vibes. **Glyph‑by‑glyph tables** (ka/ma/ya; ra/śa; visarga; numerals) across **Tamil‑Brāhmī → Late Southern Brahmī/Grantha‑Pallava → Kawi/Cham** families; **orthographic habits** (word dividers/virāma use); and **formula concordance** (śrī‑, mahārāja‑, yūpa/yajña, śreṇi/nigama) are our diagnostics. Where we can align a dated SEA stone to a South‑Indian ductus plate within ±50–100 years, we badge **B**, and we move to **A** only when a **dated** artefact \+ **palaeographic match** \+ **secure archaeological context** coincide. [Unicode+1](https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2020/20284r-kawi.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

## **1\) The Vaigai → Pallava–Grantha hypothesis (1,150 words) — *Program, not teleology***

**Frame.** The fertile **Vaigai–Kāverī** belt supplies the densest early Tamil inscriptions (Tamil‑Brāhmī on potsherds/caves) and later the royal/corporate charters in **Pallava‑Grantha** that became the prestige export script of early Southeast Asia. Our **testable hypothesis** is that habits forged here—on palm‑leaf, copper, and stone—formed a **design space** from which SEA letterforms were adapted via maritime corridors. Start at **B** (pattern \+ multi‑site concordance); climb to **A** when a dated SEA stele and South‑Indian plate show a high‑specificity glyph match and shared formulae.

**Tamil‑Brāhmī baseline (Vaigai).** Mahadevan’s *Early Tamil Epigraphy* (HOS 62; 2003; revised 2014\) remains the canonical corpus—documenting ductus evolution (TB‑I → TB‑II), orthographic markers (e.g., early vowel length without *pūḷi*), and cave/ceramic contexts across the south. [Internet Archive+1](https://archive.org/stream/iravatham-mahadevan-early-tamil-epigraphy-from-the-earliest-times-to-the-sixth-century-a.-d./Iravatham%20Mahadevan%20-%20Early%20Tamil%20Epigraphy%20-%20From%20the%20Earliest%20Times%20to%20the%20Sixth%20Century%20A.D._djvu.txt?utm_source=chatgpt.com) The Tamil Nadu State report on **Keeladi** (Keeladi \= Kīḻaḍi) adds AMS‑dated material culture on the **Vaigai** (samples down to **580 BCE**), and crucially, Tamil‑Brāhmī names on post‑firing potsherds—evidence for wider social literacies beyond monastic caves. Caveat: dates and their civilizational claims remain debated; we treat Keeladi as **B‑class** support for an **early literate Vaigai corridor**, not as a terminus post quem for SEA scripts. [The Wire](https://cdn.thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20102444/%E0%AE%95%E0%AF%80%E0%AE%B4%E0%AE%9F%E0%AE%BF-English-08.08.19-1776Words.pdf)

**From Southern Brahmī to Grantha–Pallava.** By the early centuries CE, **Late Southern Brahmī** branches into **Grantha/Pallava‑type** letterforms used to write Sanskrit and Tamil; this family exhibits the ductus features later seen across early SEA inscriptions and the emergence of **Kawi** in Java. Salomon’s overview and Griffiths–Lammerts’ chapter on SEA epigraphy summarize this **South‑Indian southern‑Brahmī lineage** and its export; Unicode’s Kawi proposal carefully notes the **overlap** between late Pallava and early Kawi (palm‑leaf‑friendly, more cursive) that we will operationalize in glyph tables. [os.pennds.org+1](https://os.pennds.org/archaeobib_filestore/pdf_articles/bookchapters/2015_GriffithsLammerts.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**What we will actually measure.**  
 *Palaeography.* Side‑by‑side **ka/ma/ya**, the open‑top **ra**, the *śa/ṣa* contrast where present, visarga, and ligature repertoire; **numerals**; **virāma/avagraha** habits.  
 *Orthography.* Word dividers; punctuation dots; date‑formula syntax; Saka‑era numeration.  
 *Formulae & titles.* yūpa/yajña; śrī‑; mahārāja; *dātu/datuk* vs. Sanskrit *dātu* homographs; **śreṇi/nikāya/nāgara** vs. Tamil guild idioms.  
 *Surfaces & scribe habits.* Palm‑leaf curvature impacts (looped *ra*, compressed *ma*), copperplate incision depth, lithic monumentalisation.

**Confidence path.** Begin **B** (family resemblance across multiple sites), move to **A** when a **dated** SEA artifact (e.g., Kedukan Bukit 683 CE) shows a letter‑by‑letter match to dated South‑Indian plates \+ shared formulae/orthography. Each match is logged in your QA table and rendered as **glyph‑SVG plates (downloadable)** per site.

## **2\) Case study I: Kutai Yūpa (East Kalimantan, Borneo) (A for presence; B for transmission) — 1,000 words**

**Object & context.** Seven **yūpa** (sacrificial posts) carrying short **Sanskrit** texts in an early **Pallava** ductus were found near **Muara Kaman** (Kutai, East Kalimantan). They commemorate sacrifices of **King Mūlavarman**, naming his father **Aśvavarman** (“founder of the dynasty”) and his grandfather **Kuṇḍuṅga** (non‑Sanskritic), and are **palaeographically** placed in the later **4th century CE**. These are the **oldest inscriptions** of the Indonesian archipelago and an A‑class anchor for early Indic epigraphy overseas. [ANU Press](https://press-files.anu.edu.au/downloads/press/p69411/mobile/ch15s02.html)

**Script & language.** The **Pallava‑type** ductus (Southern Brahmī) is consistent with late‑4th/early‑5th‑century South India; the **meter/formulae** are Sanskritic (e.g., rājendra titles; *digvijaya* allusion to Yudhiṣṭhira). We classify the script as **Grantha/Pallava lineage** with SEA adaptation (to be confirmed on letter‑tables once we align museum photographs/estampages). [ANU Press](https://press-files.anu.edu.au/downloads/press/p69411/mobile/ch15s02.html)

**Yūpa: the ritual term that sailed.** In Vedic śāstra the **yūpa** is the sacrificial post; Brāhmaṇa literature discusses its material, orientation, and ritual semantics. That term reappears *as a public inscriptional object* in Borneo—speech turned to stone abroad. This lexical‑ritual continuity is probative as **C→B‑class** correlation when paired with the stones themselves (A‑class for presence). [Academia](https://www.academia.edu/129646504/Geophysical_approach_for_the_ancient_iron_in_Sungai_Batu_Bujang_Valley_Kedah_Malaysia?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Badge.** **A** (inscriptions present with context & editions) for **presence of Sanskrit \+ Southern Brahmī in Kalimantan**; **B** for **transmission mechanism** (we infer southern maritime corridors, but bind that inference to port archaeology and coin/amphora peaks where available).

---

## **3\) Case study II: Võ Cảnh (Nha Trang region, Việt Nam) — 900–1,000 words (A for inscription; B for lineage; debate noted)**

**Object & debates.** The **Võ Cảnh stele**, often touted as *the earliest* Sanskrit inscription in mainland Southeast Asia, is written in **Sanskrit** using a **Southern‑Brahmī/Grantha‑type** ductus. Early scholarship (Filliozat; Bergaigne; Finot) cast it in the **2nd–3rd c. CE** band; later readings argue for **4th century**. Our compilation records the **date‑band as contested**, with an **A‑class** for presence and a **B‑class** for precise dating pending a fresh palaeographic table and EFEO corpus cross‑checks. [os.pennds.org+2JSTOR+2](https://os.pennds.org/archaeobib_filestore/pdf_articles/BEFEO/1969_55_Filliozat.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Prosopography & formulae.** The stele uses **Sanskrit royal diction** and genealogical markers characteristic of early donatives; opening auspicious *śrī* and honorifics echo South‑Indian habits. We will pair this with Kanchipuram–Pallava corpora (where accessible) in the figure plates, and badge the ductus link as **B** until letter‑by‑letter matches are published in the atlas. [I saw](https://isaw.nyu.edu/publications/inscriptions/campa/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Badge.** **A** (inscription present; EFEO corpus coverage); **B** for date/lineage until the glyph tables close the loop.

---

## **4\) Case study III: Kedukan Bukit (Palembang, Sumatra) — 1,000–1,100 words (A for inscription; B for corridors)**

**Object & text.** The **Kedukan Bukit** stone (Palembang, National Museum of Indonesia) is a small boulder with **Old Malay** in a **Pallava‑type script** dated to **1 May 683 CE** (Saka 605). The text famously records **Dapunta Hyang** embarking on a **siddhayātra**, enumerating troops and supplies, and celebrating **Śrīvijaya’s** success. This is **A‑class** evidence for **a local language** (Old Malay) written in a **South‑Indian‑derived syllabary** with heavy **Sanskrit lexicon**. Primary anchors: de Casparis’s *Prasasti Indonesia II* (editions), Coedès’s classic on Malay inscriptions, and institutional summaries. [UNESCO+3Internet Archive+3sudoc.fr+3](https://archive.org/download/de-casparis-1956-prasasti-indonesia-2?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Script & formulae.** The ductus is **Pallava‑type** (Late Southern Brahmī) with orthographic choices typical of palm‑leaf practice; the prose mixes **Old Malay** with **Sanskrit loans** (svasti, śrī, *siddhayātra*, Saka dating). This **hybridity**—local language, Indic script, Sanskrit state‑craft diction—becomes a defining signature of maritime polities in the Malacca–Musi corridor. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kedukan_Bukit_inscription)

**Corridor pairing.** We pair **Kedukan Bukit** (683 CE) with archaeology from **Bujang Valley/Sungai Batu** (Kedah) to show **regional, contemporaneous** urban‑port ecologies where Indic scripts and Sanskritic state idioms were being localized. (We are careful: Bujang Valley’s iron/entrepôt horizons are not *proof* of Kedukan’s script, but they improve a **B‑class** corridor argument when mapped by date.) [Academia](https://www.academia.edu/129646504/Geophysical_approach_for_the_ancient_iron_in_Sungai_Batu_Bujang_Valley_Kedah_Malaysia)

**Badge.** **A** (inscription; date; script); **B** for specific Vaigai‑to‑Palembang scribal routes pending additional pins (copperplates, loans, monastic links).

---

## **5\) Transmission channels: Monks, Merchants, Monarchs (1,050 words) — *Network logic, not single‑pipe diffusion***

**Merchants.** South‑Indian **guilds** provide a vocabulary for collective action—*śreṇi, nigama, pūga/nakara*—attested in the **Arthaśāstra** and later epigraphy. When those lexemes or their calques appear in SEA corpora (Malay *datuk*; nikāya in Buddhist contexts), they are **C→B** correlates only when paired to an **A/B** inscriptional context. (We log exact occurrences as we publish the atlas plates.) [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/kangle1960)

**Monks.** Buddhist monastic circuits move **materials and habits**: palm‑leaf formats, copperplate charters, and donative formulae. **Acri**’s work on **esoteric Buddhism networks** shows text‑icon‑master flows across maritime Asia in the very centuries when Indic scripts are being localized; **Guy’s** *Lost Kingdoms* provides the museum‑grade object context. Both are **B‑class** supports for a **scribal habitus** that travels with teachers and relic‑cult installations. [ScienceDirect+1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/org/science/article/pii/S0006229417000326?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Monarchs.** Pollock’s *Sanskrit Cosmopolis* models **prestige Sanskrit** for **kingly self‑fashioning** from c. 300–1300 CE; the **Kedukan** text’s *svasti/śrī/siddhayātra* idiom fits that cosmopolis while still being **Old Malay** in language—a perfect instance of “language ≠ script ≠ sovereignty,” and of **bilinguality/biliteracy** in port polities. [Archive.org](https://dn790009.ca.archive.org/0/items/IndianEpigraphy/Indian%20Epigraphy.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Ports & strata (pairing rule).** The Indian anchors at **Muziris/Pattanam** (Roman amphorae, wharf‑context, bollards, canoe) and the **Kāveripattinam/Poompuhar** seabed structures are our **A/B** archaeological legs that temporalize merchant–monk–monarch claims. We deploy them as **paired evidence**—never as freestanding “civilizational” assertions. [Tamil Nadu Archives+3The MUA+3pama.org.in+3](https://themua.org/collections/files/original/26d829c7ee7983165dbfb9234469cf51.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Badge.** **B** (network model) with **A**‑class pins at Pattanam and dated inscriptions; upgraded per corridor when onomastics and formula concordances tighten.

---

## **6\) Correlating śāstra & song (900 words) — *Oral → Stone without romance***

**Sanskrit lexeme map.** We index key lexemes—**yūpa, yajña, dharma, śrī, setu, nāvika**—to textual loci and then mark their **epigraphic** overseas appearances. **Yūpa** is our cleanest case (Vedic ritual post → Kutai posts). **Dharma/śrī** are ubiquitous; their evidentiary weight rises only when **paired** with dated stones. (**Setu** remains a poor fit in this atlas; we keep it for coastal polity rhetoric elsewhere.) [Academia](https://www.academia.edu/129646504/Geophysical_approach_for_the_ancient_iron_in_Sungai_Batu_Bujang_Valley_Kedah_Malaysia?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Sangam maritime memory.** **Paṭṭiṉappālai**—the port poem of **Kāveripūmpattinam**—is rich in ship, market, and cosmopolitan imagery. We use Tamil‑text primaries as **C‑class** correlates unless **paired** to excavation layers or inscriptions. **C** does not mean “false”; it means “context, not proof.” [Project Madurai+1](https://www.projectmadurai.org/pm_etexts/utf8/pmuni0077.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Oral → Stone thesis.** Abroad, oral ritual and royal performance harden into **stone formulae** for legitimacy—opening auspicious invocations (*svasti/śrī*), grant diction, titulature. This is visible in **Kedukan’s** formula cluster; we trace parallels in **Võ Cảnh** and later **Cham/Khmer** donatives via the EFEO corpus. **B** for the pattern; **A** for each inscription page. [Wikipedia+1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kedukan_Bukit_inscription)

---

## **7\) Methods & caveats (750 words) — *Palaeography, not vibes***

**Palaeography plates.** For each site we publish **SVG glyph tables** (consonants, independent vowels, numerals, virāma/visarga), annotated with **ductus notes** (stroke order, counters, terminal curves), anchored to **photographs/estampages** from museum or corpora. **Side‑by‑side** plates show **Tamil‑Brāhmī → Late Southern Brahmī/Grantha → SEA variants (Kawi/Cham)**. Unicode’s technical dossier and Griffiths’ SEA overview supply the starting canon; our plates supply the **proof**. [Unicode+1](https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2020/20284r-kawi.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Date discipline.** We prefer **dated** stones/plates. Else, we triangulate **(palaeography \+ archaeology \+ network context)** and badge **B** or **C**. This follows your QA rubric and “no claim without a pin” rule.

**Script vs. language.** We keep the line bright: **Sanskrit** (language) appears in **multiple scripts** (Southern Brahmī/Grantha in our corridor); **Old Malay** appears in **Pallava‑type** script with Sanskrit lexicon; **Tamil** rides both **Tamil‑Brāhmī** and **Grantha**. We cite Salomon for the India‑side frame and EFEO/CIC for Champa. [I saw](https://isaw.nyu.edu/publications/inscriptions/campa/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Fraud & re‑use filters.** Provenance; chisel age; re‑use blocks; anomalous ductus. We tag uncertain items **D** pending laboratory or editorial confirmation. **All** claims in the body text resolve to a **pin** (+citation) or are **down‑badged** to a sidebar.

## **Conclusion (tight, policy‑ready)**

Read as **infrastructure**, scripts are **technologies of visibility**: they fix authority, memory, and contract in places where speech sufficed until ships stitched new ecologies. In the **Vaigai–Kāverī** zone, a repertoire of strokes and formulae matured into **Grantha/Pallava** habits that, by the 4th–7th centuries, appear in **Kutai, Võ Cảnh, and Palembang**—never as sterile clones but as **local re‑engravings** of a South‑Indian design space. The atlas we have pinned here refuses teleology. Each corridor claim is **paired** and **badged**. Each dataset drops into your **pin cards** and **QA table**, and your **multilingual HUD** keeps public‑facing prose disciplined. That is how a decolonized, testable history of “scripts that sailed” can be written—one letterform, one stone, one wharf at a time.
