# **Stone, Song, and Sea: Janajāti Memory from Petroglyphs to Monoliths in the Indo-Oceanic Arc**

**Thesis:** When sky-time (*saṅkrānti*, *varṣā*), food-time (sowing, first-fruits, harvest), and place-time (groves, stones, tanks, shores) coincide, communities create media of memory—petroglyphs, cupules, megaliths, drum vocabularies, grove laws—that store law, time, and ethics. Read together, these media chart a long cultural geography of continuity linking India’s heartlands to the Indian Ocean rim.

## **0\. Methods: Oral Archives and Rocks as Records**

### **0.1 Epistemic Stance**

This chapter reads oral genres (epic fragments, praise-songs, drum patterns, processional chants) and stone media (petroglyphs, cupules, megalith fields) as co-witnesses to lived time. We avoid the false precision of one-to-one identities (“this engraving \= this festival”) in favor of family resemblances—recurring structures of time-keeping and place-keeping. “Continuity” in this book means pattern-level persistence under change, not a pristine survival of a rite over millennia. This approach, which can be termed an "archaeology of memory," seeks to deconstruct the layered narratives inscribed upon stone, performed in song, and embedded within the landscape itself.1 It is a method that prioritizes the study of deep, slowly evolving historical structures over the fleeting chronicle of event-based history, a perspective championed by the Annales School historian Fernand Braudel as the

*longue durée*.2

**Rubric.** We grade major claims High (H), Medium (M), or Low (L) by (a) convergence across archaeology, ethnography, ecology, and text; and (b) the completeness of the continuity chain from older material horizons to living practice.

### **0.2 Venue vs. Score**

A central distinction: venue vs score. Stone places preserve the venue (ledges, panels, menhir clearings); living ritual preserves the score (drum calls, step vocabularies, first-fruits rules). When both persist—often in altered registers—continuity becomes legible. At Kupgal–Sanganakallu, pecked images, ringing ledges, and use-wear map onto pastoral approach corridors to form a performance landscape (images \+ sound \+ movement).5 This distinction allows for a more nuanced understanding of cultural transmission, where the physical stage may endure for millennia while the performance enacted upon it evolves, adapts, or is replaced, yet often retains a structural rhyme with its predecessor.

### **0.3 Cultural Ecology**

Ritual forms endure because they do work. Sacred groves store water, seed, and shade; temple trees create cool microclimates/pollinator hubs; mangrove taboos buffer storm surge. These useful effects (not merely theology) explain *longue durée* persistence. Northeast India’s sacred groves show quantifiable ecological roles alongside customary law, and Mawphlang demonstrates hybrid stewardship today.8 These groves, known as

*Law Kyntang* or *Khloo Blai*, are protected by the belief that a guardian deity (*'Ryngkew'* or *'Basa'*) resides within them, and customary laws forbid any resource extraction, from cutting trees to plucking flowers.8 Ecologically, these practices have turned the groves into vital reservoirs of biodiversity, conserving rare and endemic species, preventing soil erosion, and maintaining the local water cycle.8

### **0.4 Chain of Custody for Claims**

We distinguish assertion, attestation, and anchor:

* **Assertion:** The interpretive claim (e.g., Kupgal is a “performance landscape”).  
* **Attestation:** Published description or dataset (site plans, wear maps, acoustic notes).  
* **Anchor:** Lived practice or ecological function that makes persistence rational (e.g., water protection, fodder cycles).

## **1\. Kupgal–Sanganakallu: Petroglyphs, Rock-Gongs, Performance Landscapes \[H (site); M (bridging)\]**

On Ballari’s domes, Kupgal–Sanganakallu hosts thousands of Neolithic petroglyphs with ringing-rock faces that sound metallic when struck. Three signatures recur:

* **Iconics \+ Acoustics.** Pecked imagery (cattle, anthropomorphs, nets) and polished grooves cluster where resonance peaks; hammering wear runs along tonal “sweet-spots”.6 The dominant motifs are of long-horned, humped zebu cattle (  
  *Bos indicus*) and masculine human figures, often depicted in scenes suggesting herding, hunting, or conflict.6 These images are found alongside unusual rock depressions that, when struck with granite boulders, produce loud, resonant, gong-like tones, indicating that sound was an integral component of the site's activities.6  
* **View-sheds.** Sounding ledges command lines of sight over pastures and approach corridors; this is staging, not idle doodling.6 The petroglyphs are concentrated on the jagged boulders of a massive dolerite dyke, often in precarious positions high on the hill, suggesting that participation in the associated rituals was likely exclusive and required a degree of physical fitness.6  
* **Clustering.** Panels/grooves form zones consistent with seasonally keyed congregations; work (grinding grooves) and play (ringing) share surfaces.14 The site was not only a ritual center but also a major Neolithic axe factory, with the same dolerite dyke being systematically quarried for raw material.14 This co-location suggests that the economic activities of quarrying and tool production were themselves ritualized acts, commemorated through art and sound in the same sacred space.6

**Reading.** Boivin’s analysis of images \+ sound \+ movement grants Kupgal the status of a performance landscape.5 Sanganakallu project summaries confirm ringing rocks–grinding grooves–petroglyph clusters as an integrated complex.14 The hill is both workshop and auditorium, where technics and affect coproduce place.

**Continuity (cautious).** No present rite claims direct descent. But the form—sound-led seasonal congregation—persists in the *Wāngalā* (“hundred drums”) of the Garo, a timed thanksgiving to Misi-Saljong (Sun) with stable step vocabularies and ensemble calls; and in the *gōṭul* (Gond youth-house), a schooling of bodies in seasonal etiquette and dance. We claim structural rhyme (venue vs. score), not lineage.17

**Confidence:** H (site reading), M (bridging).

## **2\. Daraki-Chattān: Cupules and Deep Time \[M\]**

At the Madhya Pradesh–Rajasthan cusp, Daraki-Chattān concentrates cupules—hemispherical pits pecked into quartzite—with studies since the early 2000s establishing two robust points 33:

* **Technics.** Replication experiments document percussor types and micro-marks; producing cupules in this stone is labor-intensive.34 The creation of even a small cupule of 30-35mm diameter with a conical depth of 9mm on hard quartzite requires immense skill, precision, and patience, involving thousands of percussive strikes with specific types of hammerstones.34  
* **Chronology.** Excavations argue great antiquity for some sequences (Lower Palaeolithic), though windows remain under refinement.33 Excavations conducted between 2002 and 2006 yielded twenty-eight cupules on exfoliated rock slabs found in stratified contexts extending down nearly to bedrock, alongside a rich lithic assemblage including both Mode 1 (Oldowan-like) chopping tools and later Acheulian artifacts.33 Hammerstones used for producing the cupules were also found within these same Lower Palaeolithic layers, providing a direct technological link between the tools and the art and firmly refuting Eurocentric models that place the origin of art in the Upper Palaeolithic.33 While the stratigraphy is robust, direct dating has proven complex; Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) dating of one fallen, exfoliated fragment provided a  
   *terminus post quem* of the 13th millennium BP, likely dating the rockfall event rather than the art's creation.39

**Reading.** Treat Daraki as a chronological floor: marking stone is deeply ancient in the subcontinent. We resist retrofitting specific modern rites; the value here is deep practice, not a named festival. These simple, repeated marks can be interpreted as a form of "cognitive scaffolding," an externalization of thought that represents a crucial step in the evolution of the human mind: the capacity to permanently alter the surrounding environment to create a locus of memory.37

**Plate D1 (caption):** Cupule panel with metric scale; replication percussors; micro-marks.

**Confidence:** M (technology robust; dating precision improving).

## **3\. Edakkal: Wayanad’s Palimpsest in a Pass \[M\]**

Edakkal, on a corridor between Malanāḍ and the Mysore plateau, bears multi-phase engravings (anthropomorphs, animals, sign-forms) that register repeated visitation.40 Best read as a travellers’ ledger—a palimpsest where many hands and seasons layer meaning. Corridor places aggregate memory by funnelling mobility.40 The engravings are a dense, overlapping collection of motifs from starkly different periods, with the oldest possibly dating to the Neolithic (as early as 6000 BCE) and later additions including a 5th-6th century CE script from a Kadamba ruler.40 The diversity of imagery—human figures with elaborate headdresses, animals, wheeled carts, and geometric signs—suggests the site was visited repeatedly by diverse groups over millennia.41 A morphological analysis reveals a stylistic evolution from simple figures made of primary signs (canoe-like incisions, possibly from tool-sharpening) to more complex figures using secondary (crosses, triangles) and mediatory (circles, volutes) signs, with some later engravings possibly made with iron tools.42 This layering of disparate images, including a motif identified as a "man with a jar cup" strongly associated with the distant Indus Valley Civilization, supports the interpretation of Edakkal as a communal message board where different cultures passing along the trade route inscribed their presence.40

**Confidence:** M (phased, multi-use; ritual identification avoided).

## **4\. Nartiang: The Jaintia Megalithic Garden—Stones as Statute, Groves as Life \[H\]**

In the West Jaintia Hills, Nartiang arrays menhirs (uprights) and dolmens (table-stones) in curated clusters adjacent to sacred groves.46 Oral memory recalls Mar Phalyngki, royal summer stays, and clan law articulated at stones; ethnography describes oath-speech, funerary formalities, and feasting patterned across the stone clearing and the bordering grove.47 These monuments, erected between 1500 and 1835 CE, commemorate battle victories and the reigns of Jaintia kings.46 The tallest menhir, standing over 8 meters high, was erected by U Mar Phalyngki, a lieutenant of a Jaintia king, to celebrate a military triumph.46 The monoliths are organized according to a fundamental binary: upright stones,

*Ki Moo Shynrang* ("male stones"), serve as memorials, while the flat table-stones, *Ki Moo Kynthai* ("female stones"), function as clan ossuaries.46

**Reading.** Nartiang is not “prehistoric residue” but a living statute landscape: stone \= law, grove \= life support, drum \= time. The adjacency is ecological (water, seedbank, shade) and juridical (taboo, oath). For followers of the traditional *Niamtre* religion, these megaliths are central to mortuary practices, with each matrilineal clan having its own dolmen within a sacred precinct called the *Kpep* to serve as the final resting place for the bones of its ancestors, ensuring the continuity of the clan.48

**Plate N1 (caption):** Plan of menhir/dolmen clusters (spacing, cap-ratios); menhir row against grove canopy.

**Confidence:** H (ongoing use; convergent documentation).

### **Sidebar B — Nartiang: Grove–Megalith Adjacency as Living Grammar \[H\]**

At Nartiang, the “megalithic garden” is literal design grammar plus legal grammar. Menhir height/spacing, dolmen cap ratios, and cluster alignments show intentionality; oath speech and funeral cycles show rule. The grove is not backdrop; it is life support—springs, seed, shade—held by taboo. The pairing persists because it is functionally sound and ritually binding. The social order, reified by the stones, is sustained by the ecological order, which is protected by the customary laws of the grove. A threat to the integrity of the grove is perceived as a threat to the well-being of the community and the social fabric that the megaliths represent.

## **5\. River Moves, City Moves: Hastināpura’s Flood Stratum \[M/H\]**

At Hastināpura, excavations recorded a flood band near the Painted Grey Ware (PGW) horizon. The *Mahābhārata* preserves a narrative of flood-forced movement. We propose a cautious correlation: lived flood → epic motif, not identity. B. B. Lal’s 1950-52 excavations revealed that the PGW cultural layer (Period II) was terminated by a massive flood from the adjacent Ganga river, which washed away a considerable portion of the settlement and was followed by a break in occupation.53 This archaeological evidence of rupture corresponds remarkably with Puranic and epic texts that narrate the destruction of Hastinapura by a flood during the reign of King Nichakshu, forcing the Kuru dynasty to relocate their capital to Kauśāmbī.54 This is our method case for text–stratum dialogue: correlate motifs, avoid GPS-literalism. The threat of floods was a known reality for PGW communities, as evidenced by the construction of large-scale flood-mitigation structures like mud bunds and embankments at other sites such as Atranjikhera and Jakhera.57

**Plate H1 (caption):** Profile showing flood band, PGW levels; sherd motifs.

**Confidence:** M/H (good stratigraphy; textual link held as motif).

## **6\. Andaman Voices: Great Andamanese Songs as Ecological Memory**

Great Andamanese myths/songs—e.g., Phertajido (“born from bamboo”)—encode hazard memory, foraging maps, and sea knowledge. Their value here is continuity of lifeway knowledge, not datable geology. Treat the corpus as a stand-alone oral archive; linguistic-ethnographic work documents song capture and the last speakers’ narratives (e.g., Anvita Abbi’s project).58 The Great Andamanese language, a moribund koiné of what were once ten distinct languages, is a final archive of a pre-Neolithic worldview.60 Abbi's research shows a direct correlation between the degradation of the islands' environment and the loss of vocabulary, particularly a "rich ornithological lexicon".61 This knowledge is woven into their cosmology through folk tales of humans transforming into birds, which are revered as ancestors.61 The Phertajido creation myth encapsulates history (discovery of tools, fire, water), philosophy, and cosmology, preserving the unique ecological wisdom of a people on the verge of disappearance.62

**Confidence:** M (oral continuity), D (decline to time-lock).

## **7\. Ritual Soundscapes: Drums, Gongs, and Harvest Steps (*Wāngalā*; *gōṭul* lifeways) \[H/M\]**

*Wāngalā* (Garo; Oct–Nov) is a “hundred drums” thanksgiving to Misi-Saljong after harvest: crescents of dancers, named drum-calls, and fixed step vocabularies—a mnemonic syllabus keyed to season and polity.17 The festival, celebrated after the harvest is complete, is defined by the rhythmic, collective beating of the

*Dama*, a long, oval-shaped wooden drum.17 Following solemn rituals like

*Rugala* (offering of crops) and *Cha·chat So·a* (incense burning), the hills come alive with the sound of drums, gongs, and flutes.19 The choreography of the massed dance, the

*Dama Gogata*, mimics the various stages of the *jhum* (slash-and-burn) agricultural cycle, ritually re-inscribing the community's collective memory of the agricultural year.21

*gōṭul* (Gond) is the youth-house school of dance, etiquette, and law aligned to the agro-ritual year.23 As documented by Verrier Elwin, the

*ghotul* is a mandatory institution for all unmarried boys (*chelik*) and girls (*motiari*), functioning as a self-governing "living university" where Muria social norms, ritual knowledge, and moral values are transmitted through direct practice and nightly gatherings of song, dance, and storytelling.23 The structural rhyme to Kupgal is clear: venues for gathering (hills, courts) and scores (steps, calls) that are taught and transmitted.

**Plate S1 (caption):** *Wāngalā* ensemble taxonomy (drum forms/rigging); *gōṭul* interior with instrument rack; floor-markings.

**Confidence:** H/M (strong living practice; analogy to Neolithic venues framed as formal, not genealogical).

## **8\. Stones \+ Groves: Why Megaliths Sit Beside Sacred Forests in the NE \[H\]**

Across Khasi–Jaintia landscapes, megalith clusters reliably sit next to sacred groves (*Law Kyntang*, *Law Lyngdoh*) under customary law (fruit eaten within the grove; deadwood by rule).8 New ecology quantifies water retention, biodiversity, and carbon; the pairing reads as a lawscape—stone stores statute/memory; grove stores life; rite moves between them.8 These groves are tracts of virgin forest protected by the belief that a guardian deity resides within, and strict taboos forbid the cutting of trees or even the plucking of flowers and fruits, lest the deity be offended and bring misfortune upon the community.8 As a result, these groves are among the least disturbed forest patches in the region, serving as vital reservoirs of biodiversity, conserving numerous rare and endangered plant species, preventing soil erosion, and maintaining the quality of local water sources.8

**Plate G1 (caption):** Two village maps: grove boundary, springheads, menhir/dolmen clusters; oath-stone and funeral route.

**Confidence:** H (institutional continuity \+ quantitative ecology).

### **Sidebar A — Śrīraṅgam: Punnai–Tank–Procession, a South-Indian “Tree-First” Exemplar \[M/H\]**

Śrīraṅgam (Tiruchirappalli) exemplifies a tree–water–procession triad. In the temple-tree literature, *punnai* (*Calophyllum inophyllum*) is repeatedly listed among south-Indian *sthāla-vṛkṣas*; its oil lights lamps and seals seams; its shade cools processional routes; its littoral/delta habit fits Kaveri hydrology.66 The

*punnai* is explicitly identified as the sacred tree (*sthala vriksham*) of the Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple at Srirangam.69 Its flowers are associated with prosperity and deities like Shiva and Krishna, and the tree itself has extensive uses in traditional medicine.68 In Śrīraṅgam, precinct trees shade

*pradakṣiṇā* arcs and *tīrtha* embankments; float festivals dramatize calendrical peaks on water. Site-specific confirmation (photos, inscriptions) will finalize the *punnai* assignment, but the structural claim—tree–tank–procession as a single liturgical ecology—is secure. The tradition ensures continuity; when a sacred tree dies, it is ritually replaced by a new sapling of the same species in the same location, symbolizing rebirth and the unbroken sanctity of the place.66

**Figure SA1 (caption):** Procession arcs vs. *pushkariṇī*; *punnai* shade polygons; vow-loop nodes.

**Confidence:** M/H overall (H for *sthāla-vṛkṣa* institution; M for precise tree mapping pending archives).

## **9\. Ocean Edge: Littoral Rites and Seasonal Winds \[M/H\]**

Coasts encode monsoon \+ tide in shrines, fishing closures, and boat-launch rites. Along Malabar/Coromandel, *punnai* shades coastal shrines; its oil powers lamps and waterproofs hulls—ritual meeting boatcraft at the trunk.74 In the Sundarbans, the Bonbibi cycle (in

*pālā-gān*) encodes forest conduct and cyclone etiquette: who may enter; what to carry; offerings at creek-mouths; how to behave in the tidal commons. Geography-of-religion research reframes Bonbibi as risk-ethics for an estuarine life rather than “folklore”.75 The

*Bonbibi Pala-gan* is a syncretic folk drama enacting the myth of Bonbibi, an Islamic *pirani* (female saint) sent to protect the delta's inhabitants from the Hindu tiger-god Dakshin Rai.75 The performance functions as a communal ritual, allowing the community to collectively confront its anxieties and reinforce the social and ecological rules for survival in a hazardous environment.75 Littoral calendars dovetail inland harvest cycles; a fishing closure keyed to monsoon onset can coexist with a village’s post-harvest thanksgiving.

**Plate O1 (caption):** Creek-mouth shrine with launch blessing; *punnai* garlanded prow; closure calendar vs. early monsoon.

**Confidence:** M/H (strong ethnography/institution; site-specific audits ongoing).

## **10\. A Jurisprudence of Place: Law, Taboo, Oath, and Commons**

### **10.1 Statute in Stone**

Menhirs mark oath and memory; dolmens stage funerary speech; cromlechs set boundaries between “ours” and “wild.” Nartiang shows how law survives because it is practiced, not because it is inscribed in a code. Stone \+ grove is the constitutional architecture of several NE polities.48 The gendered distinction between upright male stones (

*Ki Moo Shynrang*) and horizontal female stones (*Ki Moo Kynthai*) is foundational to their ritual use in commemorating ancestors and housing clan remains, making the megalithic landscape a tangible charter of social and legal order.46

### **10.2 Taboo as Environmental Law**

No-take rules in groves function as de facto environmental law; fruit-within-grove taboos prevent extractive felling; deadwood rules reduce fuel pressure; processional closures grant seasonal rests to non-human systems. Modern ecology now measures the effects earlier communities intuited.8 The belief that a guardian deity will punish transgressions serves as a powerful enforcement mechanism for these conservation rules, which have proven effective in preserving biodiversity hotspots that are richer in species than surrounding disturbed forests.8

### **10.3 Commons, Risk, and Resilience**

Desert *khejri* ethics (*Śamī-pūjā*) stabilize fodder/dunes; mangrove taboos buffer surge; river-bank trees (e.g., *arjuna*) hold soil. Littoral Bonbibi norms specify behavior under cyclone risk; *Wāngalā* orchestrates re-aggregation of the social body post-harvest. Mawphlang’s case shows hybrid stewardship (custom \+ conservation).75 The

*Bonbibi Pala-gan* is a direct communal response to the existential dangers of the mangrove ecosystem, a landscape where survival depends on mediating the relationship between humanity and the tiger through a shared, syncretic ethical framework.75

## **11\. Counter-positions, Tests, and Constraints**

### **11.1 “Survivals” Skepticism**

The old “survivals” vocabulary invites lazy lineage claims. We avoid it. Continuity is patterned utility—ecologically and politically rational practice that communities refit to new theologies and polities. Kupgal is not “the ancestor of *Wāngalā*”; Kupgal is a venue logic echoed in later scores (drum choreographies).

### **11.2 Taphonomy and Equifinality**

Polished grooves can be work or play; ringing stones can be signalling or ritual. Our method prefers convergences (acoustics \+ wear \+ view-sheds \+ circulation) to single-feature readings.

### **11.3 Dating Humility**

Cupules at Daraki point to deep practice but are hard to pin to specific social forms. We do not “time-stamp” oral traditions with geology; Andamanese songs are treated as knowledge continuity, not cataclysm diaries.

### **11.4 Text–Stratum Dialogue**

Hastināpura/PGW and epic motifs are held in dialogue, not forced identity. The flood motif likely models remembered risk experiences; our atlas will list correlations and anti-correlations with explicit confidence.54

## **12\. The *Longue Durée*: A Civilizational Grammar of Place-Keeping**

**A. Calendar grammar repeats.** *Saṅkrānti* hinges (mid-Jan/mid-Apr), monsoon breaths, first-fruits discipline—performed at trees, groves, stones, tanks, shores—places with ecological jobs (shade, water, seed, fish, windbreak).

**B. Media of memory rhyme.** Petroglyph marks, megalith forms, drum calls, grove taboos, processional routes—external memory re-embodied annually (step, song, offering).

**C. Mobility \+ anchoring.** Corridors (Edakkal) are mobile archives; groves and stones anchor moving people. Processional polities (Bastar Dussehra; *Wāngalā*) use motion to re-knit region and season.

**D. Risk & resilience.** *Khejri* ethics stabilize the Thar; grove law safeguards springs/seed; mangroves buffer cyclone. Mawphlang shows persistence via hybrid rule.

**Continuity model.** Performance landscapes (Kupgal class) → Statute landscapes (Nartiang class) → Littoral calendars (*punnai*/mangrove class) \= a civilizational logic of place-keeping. Time is kept together—as sound, as stone, as tree—and rendered as law and food.
