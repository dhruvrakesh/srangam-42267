# Sacred Tree Lexicon: Botanical–Ritual Continuities across Bhāratavarṣa

## Introduction

This lexicon documents 17 tree species functioning as ritual infrastructure across the Indian subcontinent. Each entry represents convergence of botanical identity, ecological function, and ceremonial practice—a layering that suggests reciprocal selection between communities and their landscapes.

Evidence grades (H/M/L) indicate multi-source validation strength:
- **H (High)**: Multi-disciplinary convergence (ethnography + ecology + archaeology/text)
- **M (Medium)**: Strong in one domain, partial in others
- **L (Low)**: Suggestive patterns requiring additional validation

## Commentary Footnotes

### 1. Why trees first?

Across peninsular and eastern India, multiple precincts and village memories attest that tree-shrines pre-date masonry, with later enclosures built around earlier vow practices. We keep local specifics cautious until site records are appended. **[H]**

### 2. Confidence tags

- **High (H)** = multi-disciplinary convergence (ethnography + ecology + archaeology/text)
- **Medium (M)** = good in one domain, partial in others
- **Low (L)** = suggestive

This mirrors the project-wide rubric. **[H]**

### 3. Peepal–Neem "marriage"

Ritual pairing acts as a folk balancing of "hot/cool" qualities; ecological upshot is a composite shade + insecticidal micro-habitat. **[M/H]**

### 4. Desert śamī ethics

Khejri's fodder value and dune-binding make ritual protection materially rational; the Bishnoi code exemplifies law embedded in worship. **[H]**

### 5. Sarna–Karam

Song texts, performance sequences, and the first-fruits rule anchor a living moral economy; archaeological cross-dating is improving but still uneven regionally. **[H/M]**
