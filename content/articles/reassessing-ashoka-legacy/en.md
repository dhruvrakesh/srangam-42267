# Reassessing Ashoka's Legacy: Buddhism, Politics, and Ancient Indian Sects

## Opening Context: Beyond the Colonial Narrative

This article serves as a critical companion to our examination of [Ashoka's Kandahar Edicts](/ashoka-kandahar-edicts), which highlighted the civilizational continuity from the Indus Valley through Vedic traditions to Mauryan governance. While that article emphasized **linguistic and cultural continuity**, this piece provides essential **religious-political context** by examining the Śramaṇa-dominated environment of Magadha that shaped Mauryan policy.

For over a century, colonial and post-colonial scholarship portrayed Emperor Ashoka (r. c. 268–232 BCE) as a "Buddhist Constantine" – a zealous convert who made Buddhism the Mauryan state religion. This narrative, however, oversimplifies the complex religious landscape of ancient Magadha and ignores substantial evidence that Ashoka's *dhamma* was **pragmatic political philosophy** rather than sectarian evangelism.

By examining the religious traditions that dominated Magadha from the 6th to 3rd centuries BCE, we can better understand why Ashoka's approach represented **continuity with Mauryan pluralism** rather than a radical Buddhist conversion.

## Śramaṇa Dominance in Magadha Before the Mauryas

From the 6th to 4th centuries BCE, the Magadha region was a hotbed of **Śramaṇa** traditions – spiritual movements outside Vedic orthodoxy. Both **Buddhism** and **Jainism** thrived under early Magadhan kings. King **Bimbisara** (r. 544–492 BCE) of the Haryanka dynasty, for example, expanded Magadha and **patronized the Buddha**, famously gifting the Veluvana (bamboo grove) for a Buddhist monastery. His son **Ajātashatru** continued this patronage of the Buddhist Saṅgha and also supported Jain monks. The succeeding Shishunaga rulers likewise fostered these heterodox faiths – King **Kālaśoka** even hosted the Second Buddhist Council at Vaiśālī.

In contrast to the Vedic Brahmanism of other regions, **Magadha's religious landscape was dominated by these non-Vedic sects**. As scholar Johannes Bronkhorst has noted, a "rival culture" of Buddhism/Jainism **"dominated the eastern Gangetic plain during the early Buddhist period,"** with orthodox Brahmins a distinct minority in Magadha. This climate allowed *Śramaṇa* ideas – renunciation, karma, rebirth sans caste dogma – to flourish broadly.

By the time of the **Nanda dynasty** (c. 345–322 BCE), Magadha's rulers themselves leaned into Śramaṇa beliefs. The Nandas, famed for their wealth and power, appear to have been **strong Jain adherents**. The 1st-century BCE Hathigumpha inscription of Kalinga's King Kharavela records that a Nanda king **removed a revered Jaina idol from Kalinga to Pataliputra** (Magadha's capital). This act not only attests to early Jain sculptural art, but also implies **the Nanda monarch followed Jainism**. 

Jain historical texts corroborate that **Jainism was dominant in Magadha under the Nandas**, with Jain ministers guiding state affairs. Indeed, the Sanskrit play *Mudrārākṣasa*, which dramatizes Chandragupta's rise, depicts Jains as prominent figures at the Nanda court and even as secret envoys working with Chanakya. In sum, **by the end of Nanda rule, heterodox ascetic traditions – Buddhist, Jain, and other Śramaṇas – held sway in Magadha's cultural and religious life**, overshadowing the old Vedic rites.

## Early Mauryan Religious Affiliations: Chandragupta and Bindusāra

When **Chandragupta Maurya** overthrew the Nandas around 322 BCE, he inherited this pluralistic, Śramaṇa-leaning milieu. Jain tradition holds that in his later years, Chandragupta **embraced Jainism** and abdicated to become a Jain monk, eventually fasting to death at Shravanabelagola in Karnataka under the guidance of the monk Bhadrabahu. While some historians question the precise details, the story's persistence and archaeological evidence (including the site at Shravanabelagola) suggest **at minimum a strong Jain influence** on the early Mauryan court.

Chandragupta's son, **Bindusāra** (r. c. 297–273 BCE), appears to have been affiliated with the **Ājīvika sect**, another heterodox Śramaṇa tradition known for its deterministic philosophy. Buddhist and Jain sources mention Bindusāra's association with Ājīvika teachers. This further underscores that **the Mauryan dynasty did not uniformly embrace any single religion** – rather, successive rulers patronized different Śramaṇa sects, reflecting Magadha's heterodox character.

Thus, by the time **Ashoka** ascended the throne around 268 BCE, the Mauryan Empire had already demonstrated **religious pluralism and tolerance** toward non-Vedic traditions for two generations. Ashoka did not invent this pluralism; he inherited and systematized it.

## Ashoka's Dhamma: Statecraft, Not Conversion

Ashoka's inscriptions – the famous **rock and pillar edicts** – reveal a ruler concerned with **moral governance and social harmony**, not theological orthodoxy. The term *dhamma* (Sanskrit *dharma*) in his edicts encompasses **ethical conduct, respect for elders, non-violence (*ahiṃsā*), and religious tolerance** – principles shared across Buddhism, Jainism, and even reformed Brahmanism.

Critically, Ashoka's **Rock Edict XII** explicitly commands respect for all sects:

> **"One should honor another man's sect... Whoever praises his own sect or blames other sects... does so out of devotion to his own sect, thinking 'I will glorify my own sect.' But doing so, he injures his own sect more gravely."**

This is not the language of a **Buddhist evangelist** trying to convert the empire. Rather, it is the pragmatic policy of a ruler managing a **religiously diverse population**. Ashoka promoted *dhamma* as a **unifying ethical framework** that could appeal to Buddhists, Jains, Ājīvikas, and even Brahmins – much as his grandfather and father had patronized multiple traditions.

Furthermore, while Ashoka did support the Buddhist Saṅgha (building stupas, sponsoring the Third Buddhist Council at Pataliputra), he also **funded Brahmins and Ājīvikas**, as mentioned in his inscriptions. His *dhamma* officers (*dharma-mahāmātras*) were tasked with promoting ethical behavior across all religious communities, not specifically spreading Buddhism.

In short, **Ashoka's *dhamma* was a form of statecraft** designed to promote social order and moral conduct in a vast, multi-ethnic, multi-religious empire. It drew heavily on Śramaṇa ethical concepts (like *ahiṃsā*) because those were already dominant in Magadha, but it was **not sectarian Buddhism**.

## Colonial Narratives and Modern Reassessment

The idea of Ashoka as a "Buddhist Constantine" gained traction during the **19th and early 20th centuries**, when British and European scholars interpreted his edicts through a Christian lens – viewing his support for Buddhism as analogous to Constantine's adoption of Christianity as a state religion. This narrative was convenient for colonial historiography, which often sought to find parallels between Indian and European history to make the former more "comprehensible" to Western audiences.

However, **post-colonial scholarship** has increasingly recognized this interpretation as **anachronistic and reductive**. Unlike Constantine, who actively suppressed pagan cults and convened church councils to enforce doctrinal unity, Ashoka:

1. **Never declared Buddhism the state religion**
2. **Continued to fund non-Buddhist sects**
3. **Emphasized pluralism and tolerance** in his inscriptions
4. **Used the term *dhamma* (a broad ethical concept) rather than *bauddha* (explicitly "Buddhist")**

Modern historians like Bronkhorst, Romila Thapar, and others have reframed Ashoka's legacy as that of a **pragmatic statesman** who, emerging from the Śramaṇa-dominated culture of Magadha, promoted an inclusive moral philosophy to stabilize his empire. His personal leanings toward Buddhism did not translate into **religious coercion or conversion campaigns**.

## Conclusion: Ashoka in Context

When we situate Ashoka within the longue durée of Magadhan history – from the Buddhist patronage of Bimbisara, through the Jain connections of the Nandas, to the Ājīvika associations of Bindusāra – his policies appear less as a **radical Buddhist conversion** and more as a **culmination of two centuries of Śramaṇa influence** in the region. His *dhamma* was **sophisticated imperial policy**, leveraging the moral vocabulary of heterodox traditions to unify a diverse realm.

The colonial "Buddhist Constantine" narrative obscures this complexity, projecting European religious history onto India. A more accurate assessment recognizes Ashoka as a product of **Magadha's unique religious culture** – one that had long favored non-Vedic traditions – and his *dhamma* as **pragmatic statecraft** rather than sectarian zeal. This does not diminish his significance; rather, it situates him more accurately within the **pluralistic, Śramaṇa-dominated world** he actually inhabited.
