# Reassessing Ashoka's Legacy: Buddhism, Politics, and Ancient Indian Sects

## Article Overview

**Post-colonial scholarly reassessment of Emperor Ashoka's religious identity and political philosophy**

Challenges the colonial-era "Buddhist Constantine" narrative by situating Ashoka within Magadha's three-century tradition of Śramaṇa (non-Vedic) religious dominance. Demonstrates that Ashoka's *dhamma* represented pragmatic statecraft and continuity with Mauryan pluralism rather than Buddhist conversion or evangelism.

## Article Structure

### Opening Context (NEW)

### Section 1: Śramaṇa Dominance in Magadha Before the Mauryas (6th–4th Century BCE)
- Haryanka dynasty: Buddhist patronage (Bimbisara, Ajātashatru)
- Shishunaga dynasty: Buddhist councils (Kālaśoka)
- Nanda dynasty: Jain adherence (Hathigumpha inscription evidence)

### Section 2: Early Mauryan Religious Affiliations
- Chandragupta's Jain connections (Shravanabelagola tradition)
- Bindusāra's Ājīvika affiliation
- Pattern of religious pluralism across first two Mauryan rulers

### Section 3: Ashoka's Dhamma: Statecraft, Not Conversion
- Rock Edict XII on religious tolerance (primary source)
- Dhamma as inclusive ethical framework, not Buddhist doctrine
- Funding of multiple sects (Brahmins, Ājīvikas, Buddhists)
- Dharma-mahāmātras as ethical officers, not Buddhist missionaries

### Section 4: Colonial Narratives and Modern Reassessment
- 19th–20th century "Buddhist Constantine" interpretation
- Christian lens applied to Indian history
- Post-colonial corrections (Thapar, Bronkhorst)
- Contrast: Constantine (doctrinal enforcement) vs. Ashoka (pluralism)

### Conclusion: Ashoka in Context
