# From Cosmic Island to Sacred Land: Tracing the Conception of Jambudwipa and Bharatvarsha in Vedic and Puranic Literature

## I. Introduction: Defining a Civilizational Geography

The ancient Sanskrit literary tradition of India presents a remarkably sophisticated and evolving conception of the world, one that moves from a grand, mythological cosmography to a detailed, terrestrial geography. This paper traces the intellectual and cultural journey of this geographical self-perception, arguing that it demonstrates a continuous and deeply rooted civilizational consciousness. The central thesis is that the conceptual space of ancient India evolves from the cosmic, mythological framework of Jambudwipa—the central continent in a multi-layered universe—to the geographically specific and culturally resonant entity of Bharatvarsha. This transition is not an abrupt shift but a process of focusing a wide-angle cosmic lens onto a specific, sacred land, imbuing it with a unique identity derived from both Vedic antiquity and Puranic systematization.

The methodology employed is a close reading of primary Sanskrit literature, with a focus on critical editions where available. Key texts include the Shatapatha Brahmana, which provides a foundational narrative of eastward civilizational expansion; the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute (BORI) Critical Edition of the Mahabharata, which codifies the epic tradition of Bharatvarsha's origins; and the Bhuvanakosha (geographical) sections of major Puranas such as the Vishnu Purana, Markandeya Purana, and Vayu Purana. These primary sources provide the textual bedrock for understanding how ancient Indian thinkers conceptualized their world.

This analysis is further enriched and contextualized through the scholarly frameworks of pioneering Indologists like H.C. Raychaudhary and B.C. Law, who first systematically mapped this literary geography.

Their work is complemented by contemporary scholars such as Bibek Debroy, who argues for reading these texts as a form of history (itihasa), and Meenakshi Jain, who posits 'Bharat' as an unbroken civilizational identity. The theories of Bal Gangadhar Tilak on Vedic antiquity, while controversial in their conclusions, are considered for their methodological attempt to ground textual narratives in empirical data.

This report will navigate from the macrocosm to the microcosm. It begins by establishing the grand Puranic worldview, situating Bharatvarsha within the cosmic island of Jambudwipa. It then deconstructs the etymology and antiquity of the name 'Bharatvarsha' itself, revealing a deliberate synthesis of Vedic tribal legacy and Puranic imperial narrative.

Following this, the paper will anatomize the specific geographical knowledge encoded in the Puranic texts, detailing the mountains, rivers, and peoples that constitute the physical body of the nation. The analysis will then trace these concepts back to their Vedic antecedents, exploring the expansion of the geographical horizon from the Sapta Sindhu region. Finally, by integrating the interpretations of modern scholars, the paper will conclude that the idea of Bharatvarsha is one of the world's most ancient and enduring projects of defining a cultural and geographical nation, an identity born not of modern political exigency but of a continuous, sophisticated intellectual tradition.

## II. The Puranic Worldview: Jambudwipa as the Central Continent

Before the specific geography of Bharatvarsha can be understood, it must be situated within the vast, structured cosmos envisioned by the Puranic authors. This worldview, known as the Bhuvanakosha, is not merely a collection of myths but a systematic attempt to map the universe, placing the known world within a divinely ordered and multi-layered reality. At the heart of this cosmography lies the concept of Jambudwipa, the central continent upon which the drama of gods, sages, and humanity unfolds.

### The Sapta-Dvipa Model

The Puranic texts, with remarkable consistency, describe the terrestrial plane (Bhumandala) as a series of seven concentric island-continents, a model known as Sapta-Dvipa Vasumati. The Vishnu Purana, Markandeya Purana, and Vayu Purana, among others, present a canonical list of these seven dvipas: Jambu, Plaksha, Salmali, Kusha, Krauncha, Shaka, and Pushkara. Each island is separated from the next by a unique encircling ocean.

The Vishnu Purana specifies these oceans as being composed of salt water (Lavaṇa), sugarcane juice (Ikṣu), wine (Surā), clarified butter (Sarpi), curds (Dadhi), milk (Dugdha), and fresh water (Jala), respectively. This intricate and symmetrical model portrays a universe that is both vast and meticulously ordered, a cosmos where every element has its designated place.

### Jambudwipa: The Central Island

At the very center of this cosmic arrangement is Jambudwipa, the innermost of the seven continents. Also referred to as Sudarshanadvipa, its name is derived from a colossal Jambu tree (*Syzygium cumini*) that stands upon the central mountain, Mount Meru. The Puranas describe this tree in fantastical terms: its fruits are said to be as large as elephants, and when they fall and decompose, their juice forms the Jambu river (Jambunadi).

The inhabitants who drink from this river are blessed with health, contentment, and long life. The soil on its banks, saturated with this divine juice, transforms into a special kind of gold known as Jāmbunada, used to fashion ornaments for celestial beings (Siddhas).

The geography of Jambudwipa is dominated by the golden Mount Meru, which functions as the cosmic axis of the world, the pericarp of the lotus-shaped continent. Its peak, reaching high into the heavens, is the site of Brahmapuri, the magnificent city of the creator god Brahma. This celestial city is encircled by the cities of Indra and seven other principal deities, reinforcing the concept that the world's geography is divinely centered and hierarchically organized, with the realm of the gods at its apex. From the foot of Vishnu, the celestial river Akasha Ganga descends, encircling Brahmapuri before splitting into four mighty streams that flow in the four cardinal directions to irrigate the lands of Jambudwipa.

### The Nine Varshas of Jambudwipa

Jambudwipa itself is subdivided into nine distinct regions or zones, known as varshas. The Markandeya Purana and Vishnu Purana describe a symmetrical arrangement of these zones around the central varsha of Ilavrita, where Mount Meru is located. Ilavrita occupies the elevated center of the continent.

To its north lie the varshas of Ramyaka, Hiranmaya, and Uttarakuru. To the south are Hari-varsha, Kimpurusha-varsha, and, most significantly, Bharatvarsha. To the west of Ilavrita is Ketumala, and to the east is Bhadrasva.

These varshas are separated by six horizontal mountain ranges that traverse Jambudwipa from east to west. South of Meru and Ilavrita are the Nishadha, Hemakuta, and Himavan (Himalaya) ranges. To the north are the Nila, Sveta, and Sringavan ranges.

This structured topography creates a world that is clearly demarcated. With the exception of Bharatvarsha, the other eight varshas are described as terrestrial paradises (Svarga), where inhabitants live for thousands of years free from sorrow, hunger, or fear. Bharatvarsha is unique; it is the land of karma, where actions bear fruit and where both suffering and the path to liberation (moksha) are possible.

### Comparative Cosmographies (Buddhist and Jain)

The concept of Jambudwipa is not exclusive to Hindu texts; it is a shared feature of Dharmic cosmologies, though its form and significance vary.

In Buddhist cosmology, Jambudvipa is the southern continent of four that surround the central Mount Sumeru (the equivalent of Meru). It is distinctively shaped like a triangle with a blunted point facing south, a form often seen as analogous to the Indian subcontinent. While the other three continents are inaccessible to humans, Jambudvipa holds a unique and paramount spiritual significance: it is the only realm where humans live, the only place a being can be born human, and therefore the only place where one can become a Buddha and attain enlightenment. It is the stage for receiving the Dharma and understanding the Four Noble Truths.

In Jain cosmology, the universe (Loka) is a complex, multi-layered system, and Jambudwipa is the circular continent at the center of the middle world. With a specified diameter of 100,000 Yojanas, it is a meticulously detailed map of both the physical and metaphysical realms. This map, believed to be derived from the deep yogic vision of the Tirthankaras, serves as a Mandala or focal point for meditation. Visualizing its intricate structure of mountains, rivers, and seven regions (kshetras, including Bharata) is a spiritual practice designed to expand consciousness and guide the soul toward liberation.

The distinct portrayals of Jambudwipa across these traditions are not mere geographical disagreements but reflect fundamental differences in their core worldviews. The Puranic model is encyclopedic and genealogical; its purpose is to create a comprehensive, divinely ordered cosmos that serves as a grand stage for the unfolding of Itihasa—the genealogies of gods, sages, and kings. The Buddhist model is primarily soteriological; by designating Jambudvipa as the exclusive arena for attaining enlightenment, it transforms geography into a map of spiritual potential, rendering all other lands irrelevant to the ultimate human goal. The Jain model is both cosmological and practical; its intricate, mandala-like structure is a tool for spiritual practice, a cosmic diagram to be internalized through meditation to understand the soul's journey through the universe.

## III. The Naming of the Land: The Antiquity and Etymology of 'Bharatvarsha'

While Jambudwipa represents the broader cosmic stage, the Puranic and Epic traditions progressively zoom in on one of its southern Varshas, Bharatvarsha, endowing it with a distinct name, a terrestrial geography, and a unique civilizational identity. The etymology of 'Bharatvarsha' is not singular but layered, reflecting a masterful synthesis of ancient Vedic traditions with later Puranic and Epic narratives to forge a powerful and enduring concept of a unified cultural space.

### The Puranic Definition

The most authoritative and frequently cited definition of Bharatvarsha is found in the Vishnu Purana (II, 3.1), a verse that clearly delineates its geographical boundaries:

> *uttaraṃ yatsamudrasya himādrescaiva dakṣiṇam*  
> *varṣaṃ tad bhāratam nāma bhāratī yatra santatiḥ*

"The country (Varsha) that lies north of the ocean and south of the snowy mountains is called Bhāratam; there dwell the descendants of Bharata (Bhāratī santatiḥ)."

This seminal verse, echoed in numerous other Puranas like the Brahmanda Purana, accomplishes two critical tasks. First, it anchors Bharatvarsha firmly in terrestrial geography, defining it by two unmistakable natural frontiers: the Himalayas in the north and the ocean in the south. This act distinguishes it from the other eight, more mythical varshas of Jambudwipa and establishes it as a real, identifiable landmass. Second, it names its inhabitants the Bhāratī santatiḥ, the progeny or descendants of Bharata, thereby linking the land to a specific lineage and cultural identity.

The antiquity of this name is corroborated by epigraphic evidence. The Hathigumpha inscription of King Kharavela of Kalinga, dated to the 2nd century BCE, records his military expeditions across 'Bharatavasa' (the Prakrit form of Bharatvarsha), confirming that the name was in use as a geographical and political designator well beyond purely literary circles.

### The Imperial Tradition: Emperor Bharata

To explain the origin of the name and the identity of the eponymous ancestor, the Mahabharata and several Puranas narrate the story of the great Chakravartin (universal emperor) Bharata. The Adi Parva of the Mahabharata, as constituted in the BORI Critical Edition and translated by scholars like Bibek Debroy, presents this foundational narrative. Bharata was the son of King Dushyanta of the Chandravamsha (Lunar Dynasty) and the celestial nymph Shakuntala.

The story details his divine parentage, his prodigious strength even as a child—when he was known as Sarvadamana ("subduer of all") for his ability to tame lions and tigers—and his eventual recognition by his father. Upon ascending the throne, Bharata embarked on a campaign of universal conquest (digvijaya), uniting the entire known world under his righteous rule. In his honor, the vast empire he forged came to be known as 'Bharatavarsha', the land of Bharata.

This narrative provides a powerful political and dynastic rationale for the unity of the land, grounding its identity in the legacy of a single, unifying sovereign.

### The Vedic Antecedent: The Bharata Tribe

The name 'Bharata', however, possesses a far deeper antiquity, predating the Epics and Puranas. The Rigveda, the oldest stratum of Sanskrit literature, repeatedly mentions the Bharatas as one of the most prominent tribes of the early Vedic period. Their geographical heartland was the region around the sacred Sarasvati River.

The seventh Mandala of the Rigveda chronicles their most significant achievement: under the leadership of their king, Sudas, the Bharatas emerged victorious in the Dāśarājñá, the Battle of Ten Kings, fought on the banks of the Parushni (modern Ravi) river. This decisive victory established their political supremacy over a confederation of other tribes, including their former allies, the Purus. In the aftermath, the Bharatas expanded their territory eastward, and in a subsequent political realignment, merged with the Purus to form the Kuru kingdom—the very kingdom that forms the political backdrop of the Mahabharata.

The multiple etymologies presented for 'Bharata'—one tracing to a Vedic tribe, the other to an Epic emperor—are not a sign of historical confusion. Rather, they represent a deliberate and brilliant act of civilizational synthesis. The authors of the Mahabharata and the Puranas, writing centuries after the Vedic period, were engaged in the monumental task of creating a unifying narrative for a geographical and cultural landscape far vaster than the Sapta Sindhu region of the Rigveda.

They achieved this by taking the prestigious and ancient name of the Bharata tribe, a name that carried the sacrosanct authority of the Vedas, and weaving it into a new, grander narrative. They created the figure of Emperor Bharata, an eponymous ancestor whose legendary empire matched the geographical scope they sought to define. This act of narrative engineering brilliantly linked the Puranic worldview to the revered Vedic tradition.

It transformed the legacy of a specific, albeit powerful, tribe into the inheritance of an entire subcontinent. Consequently, the term Bhāratī santatiḥ—"the descendants of Bharata"—was ingeniously expanded from a literal tribal lineage into a metaphorical, all-encompassing civilizational identity. It came to signify all the peoples who dwelled within the sacred geography of Bharatvarsha, creating a powerful and enduring charter for a unified cultural space with deep, unbroken historical roots.

## IV. The Anatomy of a Nation: The 'Bhuvanakosha' of Bharatvarsha

The Puranic and Epic conception of Bharatvarsha was not merely an abstract name or a vague mythological notion. The Bhuvanakosha sections of these texts reveal a detailed and systematic knowledge of the subcontinent's physical geography, demonstrating that Bharatvarsha was a well-mapped and empirically understood territory. These sections function as a veritable gazetteer of ancient India, cataloging its mountains, rivers, and peoples with remarkable precision, thereby giving a tangible, physical form to the civilizational entity they describe.

### The Nine Divisions (Khandas) of Bharatvarsha

While defining Bharatvarsha as the land between the Himalayas and the sea, the Puranas further subdivide this varsha into nine distinct parts, referred to as khandas or sometimes dvipas. The Markandeya Purana (Chapter 57) and the Brahmanda Purana provide a standard list: Indradvipa, Kaserumat, Tamravarna, Gabhastimat, Nagadvipa, Saumya, Gandharva, and Varuna. The ninth division is the primary landmass itself, described as being surrounded by the sea (sagarasamvrita).

The Markandeya Purana notes that these divisions are "mutually inaccessible," which has led scholars to interpret them as a combination of mainland regions, near-shore islands (like Tamravarna, identified with Sri Lanka), and perhaps more distant lands known through maritime trade or cultural contact. This ninefold division reflects a conceptualization of Bharatvarsha as a central landmass with associated, albeit separate, territories.

### The Seven Kulaparvatas (Principal Mountain Ranges)

The topographical skeleton of Bharatvarsha is consistently defined by seven principal mountain ranges, known as the Kulaparvatas or clan mountains. The Markandeya Purana and Brahmanda Purana provide an identical list: Mahendra, Malaya, Sahya, Shuktimat, Riksha, Vindhya, and Paripatra. These are not mythical peaks but are largely identifiable with the major mountain systems of the Indian peninsula, showcasing the strong empirical foundation of Puranic geography.

- **Mahendra** is generally identified with the Eastern Ghats, particularly the northern section in Odisha and Andhra Pradesh.
- **Malaya** corresponds to the southern portion of the Western Ghats, including the Travancore hills and the Cardamom Hills.
- **Sahya** refers to the northern part of the Western Ghats, stretching through Maharashtra and Karnataka.
- **Shuktimat** is less certain but is often associated with parts of the Vindhyan ranges in eastern Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh.
- **Riksha** is identified with the Satpura Range, running parallel to the Vindhyas to the south.
- **Vindhya** refers to the Vindhya Range proper, the great central Indian escarpment.
- **Paripatra** (or Pariyatra) is identified with the Aravalli Range and its western extensions.

This accurate topographical framework demonstrates a comprehensive, pan-Indian geographical survey.

### The River Systems of Bharatvarsha

The Puranic texts display an extensive knowledge of the subcontinent's hydrology, providing long lists of rivers, often systematically grouped by their mountain of origin. The Markandeya Purana (Chapter 57) and the Mahabharata's Bhumi Parva offer detailed catalogs. They mention the great rivers flowing from the slopes of the Himavan (Himalayas), such as the Ganga, Yamuna, Sarayu, Gandaki, Shatadru (Sutlej), Vitasta (Jhelum), and Iravati (Ravi).

From the Paripatra (Aravallis), they list rivers like the Charmanvati (Chambal) and Vetravati (Betwa). The Vindhya mountains are named as the source of the Narmada, Shona (Sone), and Tapti. The Riksha (Satpura) mountains give rise to the Godavari and Payoshni.

From the Sahya (Western Ghats) flow the Krishna, Bhimaratha (Bhima), Tungabhadra, Venya, and Kaveri. And from the Malaya mountains in the far south emerge rivers like the Kritamala and the famous Tamraparni. This systematic classification of river systems based on their watersheds indicates a well-developed and scientific approach to geography.

### The Peoples and Kingdoms (Janapadas)

Beyond physical topography, the texts provide a detailed human geography, cataloging the numerous Janapadas—tribes, peoples, and kingdoms—that inhabited Bharatvarsha. The Bhishma Parva of the Mahabharata contains one of the most exhaustive lists, read out by Sanjaya to the blind king Dhritarashtra to describe the known world before the great war. It mentions the peoples of the Madhyadesa (middle country) like the Kuru-Panchalas and Surasenas; the easterners (Prachyas) like the Kalingas, Magadhas, and Utkalas; the southerners (Dakshinatyas) including the Dravidas, Keralas, Cholas, and Pandyas; and the peoples of the frontiers, such as the Yavanas (Greeks), Chinas (Chinese), Kambojas, and Hunas in the north and west. The Markandeya Purana likewise arranges the principal peoples according to the natural regions of the country, presenting a vision of Bharatvarsha as a diverse and pluralistic, yet conceptually unified, political and cultural landscape.

## V. Vedic Precursors and Civilizational Expansion

The detailed and expansive geography of the Puranic Bharatvarsha did not emerge in a vacuum. It represents the culmination of a long process of exploration and conceptualization, the roots of which lie deep in the Vedic period. The earliest Vedic texts depict a more circumscribed geographical world, centered on the northwestern part of the subcontinent.

Later texts, notably the Shatapatha Brahmana, preserve narratives that chronicle the eastward expansion of this world, framing it as a sacred, ritualistic process. This evolution in geographical knowledge is intrinsically linked to the identity of its inhabitants, the 'Arya', a term denoting cultural and ethical adherence rather than racial lineage.

### The Rigvedic Horizon: Sapta Sindhu

The geographical heartland of the Rigveda, the oldest of the Vedas, is the Sapta Sindhu, or the "land of seven rivers". The primary textual source for this geography is the Nadistuti Sukta ("Hymn in Praise of Rivers"), which constitutes the 75th hymn of the 10th Mandala. This hymn provides a veritable map of the Vedic world by enumerating the rivers known to its composers.

The list begins with the Ganga and Yamuna in the east and moves progressively westward, naming the Sarasvati, Shutudri (Sutlej), Parushni (Ravi), Asikni (Chenab), and Vitasta (Jhelum). It then extends further northwest to include the Sindhu (Indus)—the mightiest and most celebrated river in the hymn—and its western tributaries like the Kubha (Kabul), Krumu (Kurram), and Gomati (Gomal), rivers located in modern-day Afghanistan and Pakistan. The geographical focus is unmistakably on the Punjab and its northwestern frontiers.

The Ganga is mentioned only once, marking the easternmost edge of this early horizon. This provides a crucial baseline from which to measure the subsequent expansion of the Vedic world.

### The Narrative of Expansion: The Story of Videgha Mathava

A seminal narrative preserved in the Shatapatha Brahmana (c. 800-600 BCE) mythologically chronicles the process of this eastward expansion. The story recounts the journey of King Videgha Mathava and his priest, Gotama Rahugana.

Initially, they resided on the banks of the Sarasvati river, the center of the old Vedic world. From there, they followed Agni Vaishvanara—the sacrificial fire, described as "common to all men"—as it burned its way across the land towards the east. Agni burned over and dried up all the rivers in its path until it reached a large river flowing from the northern mountains called the 'Sadanira' (literally "always with water"), which is widely identified with the modern Gandak river in Bihar.

Agni did not burn over this river, and the text notes that "in former times, Brāhmans did not cross that one, thinking, 'it has not been burnt over by Agni Vaiśvānara'". Mathava then established his kingdom, Videha, to the east of the Sadanira.

This narrative is far more than a simple migration tale; it is a foundational myth that frames civilizational expansion as a sacred, ritually sanctioned process. The prime mover in the story is not the king or his priest, but Agni, the very embodiment of Vedic sacrificial culture. The human actors merely follow the divine principle.

Agni's "burning" of the land symbolizes the clearing of dense forests for agriculture and settlement, but on a deeper level, it represents the ritual purification and consecration of the territory. The land that Agni has passed over is land that has been made fit for Vedic life, sacrifice, and social order. The Sadanira river thus becomes a temporary frontier, not because it is physically impassable, but because it marks the boundary of the ritually incorporated Vedic world.

The narrative provides a powerful religious charter for territorial expansion, establishing a paradigm where the spread of the Vedic people is synonymous with the spread of Dharma. It is the mythological and ideological bridge that connects the limited Sapta Sindhu of the Rigveda to the much wider Bharatvarsha of later texts.

### The Identity of the Inhabitants: The Meaning of 'Arya'

The identity of the people undertaking this expansion has been a subject of much debate, largely due to the misinterpretations of the term 'Arya' by 19th-century European scholars. Within the Vedic and Puranic texts themselves, 'Arya' is overwhelmingly a cultural, ethical, and linguistic designator, not a racial one. The word means "noble," "honorable," "respectable," or one who is faithful to the religion and traditions of the land.

As Sri Aurobindo noted, in the Veda, the 'Aryan peoples are those who had accepted a particular type of self-culture, of inward and outward practice, of ideality, of aspiration'. The fundamental opposition presented in the texts is not between races but between ways of life: the Arya, who performs the correct sacrifices and upholds Dharma, versus the Anarya (non-Arya) or Dasyu, who does not. In later texts, the term 'Arya' often refers specifically to the three upper varnas (Brahmana, Kshatriya, Vaishya) who are eligible for Vedic initiation and study.

This cultural definition is inherently porous and allows for the assimilation of diverse groups into the 'Aryan' fold through the adoption of its language, rituals, and social norms. The expansion described in the Shatapatha Brahmana is therefore best understood not as a racial conquest, but as the eastward spread of a distinct cultural and religious system.

## VI. Scholarly Lenses: Reconstructing Ancient Geography and Identity

The modern academic understanding of ancient Indian geography and civilizational identity has been built upon the foundational work of scholars who meticulously analyzed the vast corpus of Sanskrit literature. From the pioneering efforts to map the Puranic world to contemporary arguments about an unbroken civilizational continuum, these scholarly interpretations provide essential lenses through which to view the primary texts.

### The Pioneers: B.C. Law and H.C. Raychaudhuri

In the early 20th century, scholars like Bimala Churn Law and Hemchandra Raychaudhuri undertook the monumental task of systematically studying the geographical data embedded in ancient Indian texts. Their work was crucial in establishing that the Epics and Puranas, far from being mere collections of myths, contained a wealth of empirical information. B.C.

Law described these texts as a "rich mine of geographical information," emphasizing that the Bhuvanakosha sections provide a "fairly accurate account" of India's territorial divisions, rivers, mountains, and peoples. He demonstrated that while a "fabulous element" existed, particularly concerning lands outside India, the descriptions of Indian topography were generally "sober" and substantially correct. Similarly, H.C.

Raychaudhuri's seminal work, *Studies in Indian Antiquities*, dedicates significant analysis to the "Study of Ancient Indian Geography" and "India in Puranic Cosmography". By treating the geographical sections of the Puranas as serious sources, these pioneers validated their use for historical reconstruction and laid the groundwork for all subsequent research in the field. They moved the study of Puranic geography from the realm of mythology to that of historical inquiry.

### The Text as History: Bibek Debroy

Contemporary scholar and translator Bibek Debroy has been a prominent advocate for reading the Purana-Mahabharata corpus as a form of history. He champions the traditional Indian view that these texts represent Itihasa—literally, "thus indeed it was" or "this is what happened". Debroy acknowledges that the process of oral transmission over centuries inevitably led to "embellishments and additions," but he maintains that "in its core, this is Itihasa".

He argues that the "enormous amount of geographical detail" contained within these narratives is a key reason to take them seriously as historical-cultural documents, as this detail grounds the stories in a tangible, real-world context. His monumental, unabridged translations of the BORI Critical Edition of the Mahabharata and numerous Puranas are predicated on this principle, making the authentic textual tradition accessible and encouraging a reading that respects its internal claims to be a record of the past.

### The Civilizational Continuum: Meenakshi Jain

Historian Meenakshi Jain has powerfully articulated the argument for 'Bharat' as an ancient and unbroken civilizational identity. Drawing upon Puranic and Epic sources in conjunction with archaeological and epigraphic evidence, she posits a deep-rooted, indigenous consciousness of a unified cultural and geographical space. Jain views the ideals of pan-Indian political unity articulated in texts like the Mahabharata and the Vishnu Purana as evidence of a pre-modern national conception.

Her work directly challenges colonial and post-colonial historiographical trends that have often dismissed or ignored this indigenous self-awareness, framing it instead as a recent, British-inspired invention. For Jain, the concept of Bharatvarsha, rooted in the land's sacred geography and its epic history, represents a continuous civilizational identity that has persisted for millennia, demonstrating resilience in the face of invasions and historical ruptures.

### The Antiquity Debate: Bal Gangadhar Tilak

While his specific theories are not accepted by mainstream scholarship today, Bal Gangadhar Tilak's work at the turn of the 20th century represented a significant methodological intervention. In his books *Orion or Researches into the Antiquity of the Vedas* (1893) and *The Arctic Home in the Vedas* (1903), Tilak pioneered the use of internal astronomical data to argue for a much greater antiquity for the Vedic texts than was accepted by Western scholars of his time. By analyzing astronomical statements, such as the position of the vernal equinox in the constellation of Orion (Mṛgaśiras), he proposed a date of circa 4500 BCE for the composition of many Rigveda hymns.

He further argued that descriptions of long dawns, long nights, and revolving skies in the Rigveda were memories of a time when the Vedic people inhabited the Arctic regions, before a post-glacial migration southward. While modern geology and archaeology do not support the "Arctic Home" theory, Tilak's approach was groundbreaking. It asserted that the Vedas were not merely collections of primitive hymns but contained scientifically analyzable data that could be used to reconstruct a deep history, thereby challenging the colonial-era chronologies and reinforcing the indigenous view of the texts' immense antiquity.

## VII. Conclusion: The Enduring Idea of Bharatvarsha

The journey through the Sanskrit textual tradition reveals a profound and dynamic process of civilizational self-definition. The geographical consciousness of ancient India did not begin with a fixed map but with a grand cosmic vision. The Puranic model of the Sapta-Dvipa world, with the divine Mount Meru at the center of Jambudwipa, established a universe that was vast, ordered, and sacred.

This was the macrocosmic stage upon which the world's story was set. From this expansive, mythological geography, the intellectual focus gradually narrowed, concentrating on a specific, terrestrial realm: the Varsha lying south of the Himalayas and north of the ocean.

This land was given a name, Bharatvarsha, that was itself an act of profound cultural synthesis. By weaving together the ancient, revered memory of the Vedic Bharata tribe with the new, unifying narrative of a great eponymous emperor, the authors of the Epics and Puranas created a civilizational charter. The name 'Bharata' and the identity of its people, the Bhāratī santatiḥ, were grounded in the sacrosanct authority of the Veda while being expanded to encompass a much larger and more diverse population. This was not the invention of a tradition, but its brilliant re-articulation for a new era.

This conceptual nation was then given a physical body. The Bhuvanakosha sections of the Puranas and the Mahabharata meticulously mapped the anatomy of Bharatvarsha, delineating its principal mountain ranges (Kulaparvatas), its extensive river systems, and its diverse peoples and kingdoms (Janapadas). This detailed, empirical geography demonstrates that Bharatvarsha was not an imaginary utopia but a known and lived-in reality. The textual record, from the Rigveda's Sapta Sindhu to the Shatapatha Brahmana's narrative of eastward expansion under the banner of Agni, chronicles the very process by which this land was settled, sacralized, and brought into the fold of a shared cultural world.

The Sanskrit textual tradition, therefore, does not present a static or monolithic worldview. Instead, it documents a dynamic and evolving process of conceptualizing a distinct civilizational space. The idea of Bharatvarsha, as constructed through the layers of Vedic memory, Epic narrative, and Puranic systematization, represents one of history's most ancient and enduring projects of defining a cultural and geographical nation.

It is an idea born not of modern political necessity or colonial cartography, but of an indigenous, continuous, and sophisticated intellectual tradition that sought to understand and articulate the sacred and physical boundaries of its world. This idea, rooted in the land and its people, has remained a powerful and resonant signifier of civilizational identity for millennia, a testament to the enduring power of a geography conceived as both sacred and real.
