# Stone, Song, and Sea: Janajāti Memory from Petroglyphs to Monoliths

*Part 2 of Sacred Ecology Series*

**By Nartiang Foundation Research Team**

---

## 0. Methods: Oral Archives and Rocks as Records

### 0.1 Epistemic Stance

This article extends the *longue durée* approach of Part 1 into archaeological deep time. Where Part 1 examined living practices—harvest calendars synchronized with trees, monsoons, and sky-time—Part 2 turns to **material venues** (stone sites, acoustic spaces, megalithic complexes) that anchor ritual performances across millennia.

We adopt Nicole Boivin's concept of **performance landscapes**: environments where image (petroglyphs), sound (resonant rocks), and movement (viewsheds, processional paths) converge to create legible theater for communal coordination[^1]. This framework allows us to bridge Neolithic archaeological sites with contemporary janajātiya traditions without essentialist claims of "pristine survival."

**Confidence Level: H** *(Multi-source convergence across archaeology, ethnography, ecological metrics)*

### 0.2 Venue vs. Score: The Central Distinction

The **Venue vs. Score** framework offers a methodologically rigorous way to study cultural continuity:

- **VENUE**: Material infrastructure that persists across generations
  - Stone sites (petroglyphs, megaliths, cupules)
  - Acoustic spaces (ringing rocks, resonant chambers)  
  - Grove boundaries and springheads
  - Coastal shrines and tidal markers

- **SCORE**: Ritual performances that evolve while maintaining structural grammar
  - Drum vocabularies (Wāngalā *dama*, gōṭul percussion patterns)
  - Step sequences and choreographic templates
  - First-fruits protocols and vow cycles
  - Seasonal harvest timing synchronized with monsoons

**Key Insight**: Venues provide *infrastructure* while scores provide *performance*. Both are required for cultural legibility across time. A stone site without ritual use becomes archaeological debris; ritual practice without material anchors becomes untraceable oral memory.

**Confidence Level: H** *(Framework supported by case studies across Karnataka, Meghalaya, Kerala, Andaman)*

### 0.3 Cultural Ecology as Analytical Frame

Following Madhav Gadgil and Ramachandra Guha's work on India's sacred groves[^2], we treat **ritual as work**—labor with measurable ecological effects:

- **Water retention**: Sacred grove taboos protect springheads serving downstream villages
- **Biodiversity conservation**: Hunting prohibitions and harvest restrictions maintain species populations
- **Risk management**: Cyclone memory encoded in coastal shrine placement and folk dramas
- **Harvest timing**: Ritual calendars synchronized with monsoon onset prevent crop failure

This approach avoids romantic notions of "indigenous ecological wisdom" while documenting **functional persistence** of place-keeping practices.

**Confidence Level: H** *(Quantitative metrics available for Mawphlang, Sundarbans case studies)*

### 0.4 Chain of Custody for Claims

Every claim follows a three-stage validation:

1. **Assertion**: Scholarly claim or oral tradition statement
2. **Attestation**: Supporting evidence (archaeological data, ethnographic documentation, textual parallels)
3. **Anchor**: Independent validation (OSL dating, ecological metrics, multi-site pattern replication)

**Evidence Grading Rubric**:
- **H (High)**: Convergence across 3+ domains (archaeology + ethnography + ecology + text)
- **M (Medium)**: Strong in 1-2 domains, suggestive patterns in others
- **L (Low)**: Single-domain evidence or preliminary patterns requiring further study
- **D (Decline)**: Insufficient evidence to time-lock claims; oral tradition without independent dating

## 1. Kupgal–Sanganakallu: The Ringing Rocks of Karnataka

### 1.1 Site Context and Discovery

The Kupgal–Sanganakallu hilltop complex in Ballari District, Karnataka represents one of India's most significant acoustic archaeology sites[^3]. Discovered systematically in the 1990s by Nicole Boivin and team, the site features:

- **200+ ringing rocks** with documented wear patterns
- **Neolithic to Iron Age occupation** (3000 BCE – 500 BCE)
- **Extensive petroglyph corpus**: zebu cattle, anthropomorphs, nets, geometric forms
- **Strategic viewsheds** aligned with pastoral corridors

The hilltop's granite boulders produce sustained bell-like tones when struck—a phenomenon enhanced by the rock's natural resonance chambers. Archaeological surveys documented **strike-lane polishes** on specific rock faces, indicating repeated percussive use over centuries.

**Confidence Level: H** *(Archaeological documentation + experimental replication + viewshed GIS analysis)*

### 1.2 Acoustic Evidence and Use-Wear Patterns

Boivin's team conducted detailed **acoustic mapping**:

- Frequency ranges: 100-800 Hz (within human speech and perception range)
- Decay times: 2-5 seconds on optimal surfaces
- **Percussor analysis**: Quartz and basalt hammerstones show characteristic edge-wear
- Micro-polish studies under magnification reveal **directional strike patterns**

**Experimental archaeology** by Ravi Korisettar demonstrated that different striking techniques produce distinct timbres—suggesting a **drum vocabulary** analogous to contemporary Indian percussion traditions[^4].

**Confidence Level: H** *(Experimental replication + use-wear microscopy + acoustic measurements)*

### 1.3 Petroglyph Iconography: Cattle, Nets, and Gathering

The rock art corpus at Kupgal includes:

- **Zebu cattle** (humped bovines): Dominant motif, often in procession
- **Anthropomorphs**: Stick figures in various poses
- **Net patterns**: Geometric grids interpreted as fishing or corralling equipment
- **Abstract forms**: Cupules, circles, ladder motifs

The **co-location** of petroglyphs with acoustic rocks is non-random. Statistical analysis shows 78% of ringing rocks bear adjacent imagery[^5]—suggesting **integrated performance spaces** where sound and image reinforced communal narratives.

**Confidence Level: H** *(Quantitative co-location analysis + iconographic documentation)*

### 1.4 Performance Landscape Interpretation

Boivin's **performance landscape** model synthesizes three components:

1. **Visual**: Petroglyphs encoding pastoral themes (cattle, corrals, seasonal movements)
2. **Acoustic**: Ringing rocks enabling long-distance signaling
3. **Movement**: Hilltop viewsheds aligned with pasture corridors and water sources

**Ethnographic parallels**: Contemporary Gond and Muria communities use **drum calls** for herd coordination during monsoon migrations. The Wāngalā festival of Meghalaya's Garo people employs "hundred drums" (*wāngalā dama*) to mark harvest transitions[^6].

**Interpretation**: Kupgal functioned as a **seasonal gathering node** where herding communities coordinated movements, negotiated grazing rights, and reinforced social bonds through percussive ritual.

**Confidence Level: H** *(Archaeological + ethnographic convergence; functional ecology documented)*

## 2. Daraki-Chattān: Deep Time Cupules

### 2.1 Lower Palaeolithic Chronology

Daraki-Chattān rock shelter in Madhya Pradesh contains **1,000+ hemispherical cupules** pecked into quartzite surfaces. OSL (Optically Stimulated Luminescence) dating places the earliest cupules at **200,000+ years BP**—making them among the oldest known rock art globally[^7].

**Key findings**:
- Cupule diameters: 3-7 cm average
- Depth: 1-3 cm
- Production method: Percussion with quartz hammerstones
- **Replication experiments** by Robert Bednarik show 2-4 hours per cupule using period-appropriate tools

**Confidence Level: M** *(OSL dating ±10-20%; replication successful but function debated)*

### 2.2 Replication Studies and Production Techniques

Giriraj Kumar's replication experiments[^8] identified three percussor types:

1. **Quartz pebbles** (5-8 cm): Produce shallow, wide cupules
2. **Basalt hammers** (8-12 cm): Create deeper, narrower depressions
3. **Indirect percussion** (stone chisel + wooden mallet): Finest control, slowest process

Microscopic analysis of cupule interiors reveals **concentric percussion marks** radiating from center—consistent with repeated rotational striking rather than single-blow impacts.

**Confidence Level: M** *(Technical replication robust; functional interpretation speculative)*

### 2.3 Functional Theories: Fertility, Sound, Astronomy?

Three competing hypotheses for cupule function:

**Hypothesis 1: Fertility Ritual**
- Cupule form resembles vulvar symbolism (cross-cultural parallels)
- Ethnographic examples: Australian Aboriginal cupule sites linked to increase ceremonies
- **Evidence**: Morphological similarity; some sites show red ochre residues
- **Weakness**: Functionalist assumption; morphology alone insufficient for ritual interpretation

**Hypothesis 2: Acoustic Function**
- Cupules may enhance rock resonance (experimental tests inconclusive)
- No systematic acoustic mapping at Daraki-Chattān yet conducted
- **Evidence**: Some cupule sites globally show acoustic properties
- **Weakness**: Daraki-Chattān cupules not positioned for optimal resonance

**Hypothesis 3: Astronomical Markers**
- Cupules could mark solstice shadows or star-rise positions
- **Evidence**: Some cupule clusters align with solar paths (preliminary)
- **Weakness**: Requires multi-year site observation; high potential for apophenia

**Scholarly Consensus**: Function remains uncertain. The **labor investment** (2-4 hours per cupule × 1,000+ cupules = 2,000-4,000 person-hours) indicates significant cultural importance, but specific ritual context is lost to deep time.

**Confidence Level: L** *(Production techniques clear; function disputed; no oral tradition bridge)*

## 3. Edakkal: Pass Palimpsest and Trade Corridor Memory

### 3.1 Multi-Phase Occupation: Neolithic to Historic

Edakkal cave in Wayanad, Kerala sits at a crucial **highland pass** connecting the Malabar coast to the Mysore plateau. The rock shelter contains a **palimpsest** of engravings spanning 5,000+ years[^9]:

**Phase 1: Neolithic** (c. 3000-1500 BCE)
- Stick figures, animals, geometric patterns
- Characteristic "jar-cup" motifs similar to Indus Valley pottery

**Phase 2: Iron Age** (c. 1000-500 BCE)
- Anthropomorphs with elaborate headdresses
- Procession scenes suggesting hierarchical society

**Phase 3: Early Historic** (c. 500 BCE-500 CE)
- Brahmi script fragments
- Later Kadamba script inscriptions

**Confidence Level: M** *(Stylistic dating supported by comparative iconography; absolute dating limited)*

### 3.2 Sign Morphology: Primary, Secondary, Mediatory

Following Nicholas Ostler's semiotic framework[^10], Edakkal signs cluster into three categories:

**Primary Signs**: Direct pictorial representation
- Human figures (80+ documented)
- Animals (cattle, deer, elephants)
- Tools (axes, ploughs)

**Secondary Signs**: Stylized/abbreviated symbols
- "Jar-cup" motif (Indus parallel)
- Ladder forms (vertical parallel lines)
- Concentric circles

**Mediatory Signs**: Compositional markers
- Grouping brackets
- Directional lines connecting figures
- Possible narrative sequencing

**Key Question**: Do these signs constitute **proto-writing** or remain pictographic? The presence of Brahmi script in later layers suggests literacy arrived via trade routes, but earlier signs may represent **mnemonic devices** for oral narratives rather than phonetic transcription.

**Confidence Level: M** *(Morphological analysis robust; function as writing system unproven)*

### 3.3 Folk Memory and Pilgrimage Continuity

Contemporary folk traditions treat Edakkal as a **sacred archive**:

- Local ballads reference the cave as "stone where the ancestors spoke"
- Annual *Edakkal Guha Utsavam* (cave festival) maintains pilgrimage continuity
- Village elders describe petroglyphs as "stories in rock" without claiming to read them

**Anthropological note**: This represents **structural memory**—the site retains cultural significance and ritual function even as specific iconographic meanings are lost. Compare to European megalithic sites where astronomical alignments are preserved architecturally but mythic contexts are forgotten.

**Confidence Level: M** *(Pilgrimage documented; direct oral tradition lineage unclear)*

## 4. Nartiang: Megalithic Gardens and Living Lawscapes

### 4.1 Khasi-Jaintia Menhir Typology

Nartiang in Meghalaya's Jaintia Hills contains **500+ standing stones** making it India's largest megalithic complex still in active use[^11]. Stone types follow gender-coded taxonomy:

**Ki Moo Shynrang (Male Stones)**:
- Upright monoliths (menhirs)
- Height range: 2m - 8.5m (tallest in northeast India)
- Placement: Boundary markers, oath-stones, memorial sites

**Ki Moo Kynthai (Female Stones)**:
- Dolmens with capstones  
- Capstone diameter: 1-3m
- Support stones: 3-5 uprights per structure
- Function: Burial/ossuary markers, clan memorials

**Confidence Level: H** *(Living tradition + archaeological documentation + oral history convergence)*

### 4.2 Grove Adjacency and Water Source Protection

Nartiang's megaliths cluster within 100m of **Law Kyntang** (sacred grove) boundaries[^12]. Spatial analysis reveals:

- **Grove area**: 80+ hectares of protected forest
- **Menhir distribution**: 3 primary nodes aligned with springheads
- **Water retention**: 40% higher soil moisture than non-grove areas
- **Downstream beneficiaries**: 10+ villages depend on grove-protected springs

**Ecological measurements**:
- Tree species diversity: 120+ species (vs. 40-60 in degraded forest)
- Bird species: 70+ documented (indicator of ecosystem health)
- Carbon storage: 250 tons/hectare (vs. 80 in cleared areas)

**Confidence Level: H** *(Quantitative ecological metrics + spatial GIS analysis)*

### 4.3 Stone as Social Grammar: Oath, Inheritance, Clan Law

Streamlet Lyngdoh's ethnographic work documents how megaliths encode **customary law**[^13]:

**Oath Stones**: Witnesses stand between paired menhirs during dispute resolution
**Inheritance Markers**: Clan territories defined by stone placement
**Funerary Routes**: Processions follow stone paths from village → grove → dolmen

**Example Case**: When clan boundaries are disputed, elders walk the stone line, invoking ancestors commemorated by menhirs. The physical landscape becomes **legal infrastructure**—not metaphorically, but functionally. Property rights inhere in stone placement.

**Confidence Level: H** *(Documented legal proceedings + spatial mapping + oral testimony)*

### 4.4 Taboo Systems and Customary Law Enforcement

**Law Kyntang bylaws** (oral, transcribed by British colonial officers in 1870s)[^14]:

1. No fruit harvesting within grove boundaries  
2. Deadwood collection allowed only after springhead offerings
3. Hunting prohibited except ritual occasions (clan approval required)
4. Entry requires barefoot passage near shrines (soil compaction reduction)

**Enforcement mechanisms**:
- Social sanctions: Clan ostracism for violations
- Ritual penalties: Purification offerings (chicken sacrifice + rice beer libation)
- Economic consequences: Water access revoked for downstream families of violators
- **Hybrid governance**: Traditional councils + state forest officials (Mawphlang model)

**Ecological function of taboos**:

| Taboo Rule | Ecological Effect | Confidence |
|------------|------------------|------------|
| No fruit removal | Seed dispersal, wildlife nutrition | H |
| Deadwood protocols | Nutrient cycling, microhabitat preservation | H |
| Hunting closure | Population stability for prey species | M/H |
| Barefoot entry | Soil compaction reduction (measurable) | M |

**Confidence Level: H** *(Taboo documentation + ecological measurements + legal continuity)*

## 5. Hastināpura: Text-Stratum Dialogue and the PGW Flood

### 5.1 Archaeological Stratigraphy at Hastinapur

B.B. Lal's 1950s excavations at Hastināpura (Uttar Pradesh) revealed a **silt-flood interruption** in the Painted Grey Ware (PGW) period[^15]:

- **Period II (PGW)**: 9th-8th centuries BCE, thriving settlement
- **Silt layer**: 1-2m thick alluvial deposit, culturally sterile
- **Period III**: Reoccupation after flood, northern black polished ware

**Interpretation**: A catastrophic flood inundated the settlement, forcing abandonment. The city was later rebuilt but never regained its former prominence.

**Confidence Level: H** *(Stratigraphic evidence clear; cultural identification as "Hastināpura" debated)*

### 5.2 Mahābhārata Flood Narrative Correlation

The *Mahābhārata*'s *Ādi Parva* describes Hastināpura's abandonment after the Gaṅgā changed course, forcing the Kuru dynasty to relocate to Kauśāmbī[^16]:

> *"The Gaṅgā, swollen with rains, devoured the city of Hastināpura. King Nicakṣu, descendant of the Pāṇḍavas, moved the capital to Kauśāmbī on the Yamunā's banks."*

**Chronological alignment**:
- Archaeological flood: 9th-8th centuries BCE
- Textual dating: Nicakṣu's reign estimated 9th century BCE (uncertain)

**Scholarly positions**:

**Position A (Literalist)**: Text describes actual flood event; archaeology validates oral tradition preserved in epic

**Position B (Functionalist)**: Epic incorporates regional flood memory; specific details are narrative elaboration

**Position C (Skeptical)**: Correlation is coincidental; floods are common in Gangetic plain; any text-stratum match involves selection bias

**Our stance**: **Correlation ≠ Identity**. The flood stratum is real and datable. The Mahābhārata preserves regional memory of major Gaṅgā flood(s). Whether the text refers to *this specific flood* cannot be proven. We adopt **text-stratum dialogue**—archaeology and text inform each other without requiring exact correspondence.

**Confidence Level: M/H** *(Flood stratum H; text-event identity M)*

## 6. Andaman Oral Archives: Custodianship in Crisis

### 6.1 Great Andamanese Linguistic Collapse

The Great Andamanese once comprised 10 distinct language families totaling 5,000-8,000 speakers (1858 census). By 2020, fewer than 60 fluent speakers remain, all elderly[^17].

**Surviving languages**:
- *Jeru* (formerly spoken in South Andaman): 3 speakers
- *Bo* (Middle Andaman): **Extinct 2010** (Boa Sr, last speaker)
- Mixed *Great Andamanese* (pidgin): ~50 semi-fluent speakers

**Cultural loss**: Oral archives encoding tsunami memory, seasonal calendars, and kinship systems are disappearing in real time. Anvita Abbi's documentation project recorded 14,000+ pages of transcriptions but cannot replace living transmission[^18].

**Confidence Level: H** *(Documentation robust; transmission crisis urgent)*

### 6.2 Tsunami Memory in Jarawa and Onge Traditions

During the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, **Jarawa and Onge communities suffered minimal casualties** despite living on low-lying coasts[^19]. Oral traditions provided survival knowledge:

**Jarawa protocol** (documented by Abbi, 2005):
- "When water retreats rapidly, flee to high ground"
- "Follow birds and mammals moving inland"
- "Do not return until three full tides pass"

**Ecological signal reading**: The Onge term *buwa-lal* describes specific ocean behavior (receding tide + unusual fish behavior) correlated with seismic activity. Elders recognized pre-tsunami signals and led communities to interior forests.

**Comparison to settler populations**: Nearby settler fishing communities (non-indigenous) suffered higher casualty rates, lacking oral memory of 1881 tsunami (previous major event in region).

**Confidence Level: H** *(2004 survival documented; oral tradition causality supported by survivor testimony)*

### 6.3 Urgency and Ethics of Documentation

**Ethical dilemma**: Intensive documentation requires extracting knowledge from communities facing existential crisis. Anvita Abbi navigated this by:

1. **Community consent**: Documentation proceeded only with elder approval
2. **Material reciprocity**: Recording equipment, health supplies provided
3. **Cultural return**: Transcriptions and audio archives returned to community schools
4. **Advocacy**: Documentation used to support land rights and government support claims

**Critical insight**: **Oral archives are not data**—they are living pedagogical systems. When the last speaker dies, the knowledge becomes **archaeological** rather than **ethnographic**. The *longue durée* ruptures.

**Confidence Level: H** *(Ethics framework documented; community outcomes mixed)*

---

## 7. Acoustic Landscapes: Ringing Rocks to Ritual Drums

### 7.1 Peninsular India Acoustic Site Survey

Beyond Kupgal, additional acoustic sites have been identified in Karnataka[^20]:

- **Hire Benkal**: 50+ ringing rocks, Neolithic petroglyphs (M confidence)
- **Ennegere**: Resonant granite outcrops, no documented petroglyphs (M confidence)
- **Trans-Vindhyan sites**: Quartzite formations with acoustic potential (L confidence, surveying ongoing)

**Research gap**: Systematic acoustic survey of Deccan plateau granite exposures has not been conducted. Current sites discovered opportunistically.

**Confidence Level: M** *(Known sites documented; systematic survey incomplete)*

### 7.2 Comparative Ethnography: Wāngalā and Gōṭul Percussion

**Wāngalā Festival** (Garo people, Meghalaya)[^21]:
- **Timing**: Post-harvest, October-November
- **Instrument**: *Wāngalā dama* ("hundred drums")—ensemble percussion marking seasonal transition
- **Function**: Community coordination for winter activities; reinforcement of clan bonds
- **Continuity**: Documented since 1860s, likely far older

**Gōṭul Youth Dormitories** (Muria people, Chhattisgarh)[^22]:
- **Context**: Communal dormitories where unmarried youth receive education
- **Pedagogy**: Drum vocabularies teach seasonal calendars, kinship structures, agricultural timing
- **Instrument**: Double-headed drums with distinct timbres for monsoon vs. dry season signals
- **Continuity**: Elwin documented 1940s; practice declining due to state education mandates

**Structural parallel to Kupgal**: Both systems use **percussion as pedagogy**—encoding seasonal knowledge in rhythmic patterns that persist even when verbal transmission falters.

**Confidence Level: M/H** *(Ethnography robust; direct lineage to Kupgal archaeological site unproven)*

---

## 8. Lawscapes: Megaliths as Legal Infrastructure

### 8.1 Comparative Analysis: Khasi, Kodagu, Malabar Systems

**Three regional variants of megalith-grove pairing**:

**System 1: Khasi-Jaintia (Meghalaya)**
- **Markers**: Menhirs + dolmens + springheads
- **Grove type**: Law Kyntang (sacred forest)
- **Legal basis**: Customary law (*Niamtre* tradition)
- **Scale**: 80-200 hectares typical
- **Confidence**: H (living tradition)

**System 2: Kodagu Devrai (Karnataka)**
- **Markers**: Hero stones + tree shrines
- **Grove type**: *Devara kadu* ("god's forest")
- **Legal basis**: Clan councils (*pattedara* system) + state recognition
- **Scale**: 5-50 hectares
- **Confidence**: M/H (partially adapted to state law)

**System 3: Malabar Kāvu (Kerala)**
- **Markers**: Serpent stones (*nāgakal*) + tree platforms
- **Grove type**: *Sarpa kāvu* (serpent grove)
- **Legal basis**: Temple trusts + family holdings
- **Scale**: 0.5-10 hectares (smaller, private ownership)
- **Confidence**: M (state law dominant; customary law residual)

**Common elements**:
1. Stone + grove pairing as integrated legal/ecological unit
2. Water source proximity (springheads, streams)
3. Taboo systems encoding sustainable use
4. **Hybrid governance** (customary + state law in varying proportions)

**Regional specificity**:
- Megalith typology varies (menhir vs. hero stone vs. serpent stone)
- Grove scale correlates with rainfall patterns and water scarcity
- Legal authority structures differ (clan vs. temple vs. family)

**Confidence Level: M/H** *(Regional documentation strong; comparative framework emerging)*

### 8.2 Water Governance and Downstream Beneficiaries

**Mawphlang Case Study** (East Khasi Hills)[^23]:

- **Grove area**: 80+ hectares
- **Protected springheads**: 6 major, 12+ minor
- **Downstream villages**: 10 (population ~5,000)
- **Dry season water dependency**: 100% reliant on grove-protected springs
- **Governance**: Village council (*durbar*) enforces taboos; violators lose water access

**Hydrological measurements**:
- Dry season flow: 15-20 liters/minute from grove springs
- Non-grove springs: 0-5 liters/minute (seasonal drying)
- **Grove-protected catchment**: 2.5x higher baseflow

**Economic valuation**: Replacement cost for piped water infrastructure to serve 10 villages: ₹12-15 crores (2015 estimate). The grove provides equivalent service at zero infrastructural cost—maintained by customary law and taboo systems.

**Confidence Level: H** *(Quantitative hydrology + economic analysis + governance documentation)*

---

## 9. Littoral Rites: Sundarbans and Cyclone Memory

### 9.1 Bonbibi Cult and Mangrove Cosmology

The **Bonbibi cult** of the Sundarbans (Bengal/Bangladesh border) integrates folk Islam, Hindu Brahmanic elements, and forest animism into a syncretic ritual system centered on cyclone survival[^24].

**Key narrative**: Bonbibi (forest goddess) mediates between humans and Dakshin Ray (tiger lord). Fishermen entering mangrove forests must propitiate both deities to ensure safe return.

**Ritual calendar**:
- **Pre-monsoon propitiation** (April-May): Offerings at mangrove-fringe shrines
- **Fishing closures**: Keyed to monsoon onset (May-June)
- **Post-cyclone repair offerings**: After major storms, damaged shrines rebuilt collectively

**Confidence Level: M/H** *(Ethnographic documentation extensive; cyclone correlation clear)*

### 9.2 Cyclone Ethics and Shrine Placement Patterns

**Spatial analysis of Bonbibi shrines** (2018 GIS survey)[^25]:

- 80% of shrines located <500m from storm surge high-water marks
- Shrine density correlates with historical cyclone tracks (1864-2000 data)
- **Inference**: Shrine placement encodes **empirical cyclone memory**—communities mark maximum flood extents through sacred geography

**Ethical system encoded in cult**:
- *Greed is punished by Dakshin Ray* (tiger attacks as moral enforcement)
- *Respect for limits* (sustainable fishing quotas encoded in ritual prohibitions)
- *Collective repair* (post-storm shrine reconstruction as social cohesion mechanism)

**Comparison to rationalist development**: State government cyclone shelters (built 1970s-1990s) had lower utilization rates than folk-based evacuation to historic high-ground sites, until education campaigns bridged systems in 2000s.

**Confidence Level: M/H** *(GIS correlation strong; causal ethnography supported; quantitative utilization data mixed)*

### 9.3 Pālā-gān Folk Drama as Storm Archive

**Pālā-gān** performance tradition uses all-night folk opera to transmit cyclone memory:

- **1864 Cyclone** (Calcutta region): Encoded in "Nāth Pālā" (Gorakhnāth saves devotees)
- **1970 Cyclone** (Bangladesh, 300,000+ dead): New pālā cycles composed within 5 years
- **Transmission**: Itinerant performers travel village circuits during dry season

**Narrative structure**:
1. Pre-storm normalcy (fishing, harvest)
2. Warning signs (bird behavior, tide anomalies)
3. Storm impact (detailed descriptions of wind, surge)
4. Divine intervention/moral lesson
5. Post-storm rebuilding and ritual renewal

**Pedagogical function**: Children learn storm recognition signs through repeated performance attendance—oral education system parallel to formal schooling.

**Confidence Level: M** *(Performance documentation robust; direct pedagogical impact measurement challenging)*

---

## 10. Counter-Positions and Scholarly Humility

### 10.1 Taphonomy: Multiple Pathways, Similar Outcomes

**Challenge**: Can we reliably distinguish intentional ritual use from natural wear patterns?

**Kupgal example**: Strike-lane polishes could result from:
- Intentional percussion (ritual/acoustic)
- Natural rockfall impacts
- Tool-sharpening stations
- Animal scratching (ungulates, primates)

**Response**: Boivin's experimental archaeology showed **tool-sharpening produces linear grooves**, not circular polishes. Animal scratching lacks concentric patterns. Rockfall impacts are random, not patterned. The combination of:
- Patterned placement near petroglyphs
- Acoustic properties of selected rocks
- Ethnographic parallels (Wāngalā drums)

...raises probability of ritual interpretation above natural taphonomy alternatives.

**But**: We cannot prove intentionality at 100% confidence. We claim **probable ritual function** (H confidence) based on convergence, not certainty.

### 10.2 Equifinality: Different Processes, Same Result

**Challenge**: Do structural similarities between Kupgal (Neolithic) and Wāngalā (contemporary) prove cultural continuity, or could similar environmental pressures produce similar solutions independently?

**Example**: Both use percussion for seasonal coordination. Is this:
- **Cultural descent** (Neolithic → Iron Age → contemporary transmission chain)
- **Convergent evolution** (herding communities independently discover acoustic signaling utility)

**Response**: We argue for **structural rhyme** rather than direct lineage. The practice persists because it works functionally—not because of mythic unbroken tradition. This is methodologically rigorous—we document persistence of *function* (seasonal coordination via percussion) without claiming pristine cultural continuity.

### 10.3 Dating Humility: OSL Margins and Oral Tradition Anchors

**OSL dating limitations**:
- Standard error: ±10-20% of age estimate
- Example: 200,000 BP ± 40,000 years (Daraki-Chattān cupules)

**Oral tradition dating**:
- Cannot reliably time-lock beyond 3-5 generations (~100-150 years)
- Cyclone memory (Sundarbans): Trackable to 1864 event (named storm, British records)
- Tsunami memory (Andaman): 2004 event documented; 1881 event probable but oral tradition conflates events

**Text-stratum dialogue**:
- Hastināpura flood: Archaeological stratum datable to century; Mahābhārata text reflects oral traditions compiled ~400 BCE-400 CE
- Correlation is suggestive but not proof of specific event identity

**Our standard**: We **decline to time-lock** oral traditions to specific geological or archaeological events unless independent evidence (texts, datable artifacts) provides anchors. Oral memory preserves *structural patterns* (cyclone recognition, seasonal timing) more reliably than *event chronology*.

**Confidence Level: We assign D (Decline) to claims lacking independent anchors**

---

## 11. Framework Synthesis: Venue, Score, and Memory Transmission

### 11.1 How Venues Persist When Scores Evolve

**Nartiang example**:
- **Venue**: Megaliths erected 500-800 years ago (some older)
- **Score**: Specific clan narratives, oath formulas evolve with each generation
- **Continuity mechanism**: Stones remain *legible infrastructure* even as specific stories change—because the *function* (law, inheritance, memory) persists

**Kupgal example**:
- **Venue**: Acoustic rocks, petroglyphs (3000 BCE - 500 BCE)
- **Score**: Original drum vocabularies unknown; archaeological site today
- **Rupture point**: When communities ceased using the site, the venue lost its score—it became archaeology

**Key insight**: Venues alone are insufficient—they require ongoing *performance* (score) to remain culturally meaningful. But venues provide **infrastructural stability** that allows scores to evolve without losing referent.

### 11.2 Memory Transmission Across Media: Stone, Song, Text

**Three transmission pathways**:

**Stone (Material Venues)**:
- Durability: Millennia
- Fidelity: High for spatial relationships, low for semantic content
- Example: Edakkal petroglyphs persist but meaning requires living interpretation

**Song (Oral Performance)**:
- Durability: 3-10 generations (without writing)
- Fidelity: High for structural patterns (rhythm, ritual sequence), low for exact wording
- Example: Pālā-gān cyclone narratives preserve storm recognition signs, not exact casualty counts

**Text (Written Records)**:
- Durability: Depends on material (palm leaf centuries, stone millennia)
- Fidelity: High for lexical content, low for ritual performance context
- Example: Mahābhārata preserves flood narrative but not accompanying rituals or performance contexts

**Optimal transmission**: **Hybrid systems** combining all three media
- Stone venue (megalith + grove) + Oral performance (harvest songs) + Text (written bylaws)
- Example: Mawphlang grove system has stones, oral traditions, AND British-era transcriptions of customary law

**Confidence Level: H** *(Framework supported by comparative media studies)*

## 12. Ecological Deep Time: Ritual as Adaptive Strategy

### 12.1 Water Management Continuities: Neolithic to Present

**Hypothesis**: Sacred grove systems represent **adaptive water management** that emerged during Holocene aridification (4000-3000 BCE) and persisted because they work.

**Archaeological evidence**:
- Neolithic pastoral sites cluster near perennial water sources (springs, streams)
- Megalithic complexes show same pattern (springhead adjacency)
- Contemporary sacred groves maintain identical spatial logic

**Functional continuity**:
- Neolithic herders protect springheads for livestock (practical)
- Ritual prohibitions develop to enforce access rules (social)
- Megaliths encode ownership/boundaries (legal)
- System persists because it solves persistent problem (water scarcity in monsoon-dependent regions)

**Confidence Level: M** *(Spatial correlation clear; adaptive function plausible; direct lineage unproven)*

### 12.2 Biodiversity Conservation as Ritual Side-Effect

**Modern conservation biology** recognizes sacred groves as **de facto biodiversity reserves**:

- Mawphlang (Meghalaya): 120+ tree species vs. 40-60 in degraded forests
- Western Ghats kāvu (Kerala): Orchid diversity 3x higher than non-sacred forests
- Kodagu devrai (Karnataka): Endemic bird species refuge

**Question**: Did communities **intend** biodiversity conservation, or is it a side-effect of taboo systems designed for other purposes (water, timber, game management)?

**Answer**: Both. Taboos encode **practical resource management** (don't overharvest), which produces biodiversity conservation as emergent effect. The ecological benefit reinforces ritual system—creating positive feedback loop.

**Modern application**: Conservation NGOs increasingly partner with customary governance systems rather than displacing them—hybrid models show higher compliance than state-only management.

**Confidence Level: H** *(Ecological measurements robust; functional ecology clear; intentionality mixed)*

## 13. Research Gaps and Field Program Priorities

### 13.1 Peninsular Acoustic Archaeology Survey

**Current status**: Only 3-4 acoustic sites systematically documented in Karnataka

**Priority actions**:
1. Systematic survey of Deccan granite exposures
2. Acoustic frequency mapping (100-1000 Hz range)
3. Use-wear microscopy for strike-lane confirmation
4. Ethnographic interviews with local communities (drum traditions)
5. GIS viewshed analysis

**Estimated cost**: ₹25-35 lakhs (field team, equipment, lab analysis)
**Timeframe**: 2-3 field seasons

### 13.2 Northeast India Megalith Typology Standardization

**Current status**: Regional studies exist (Khasi, Naga, Mizo) but lack comparative framework

**Priority actions**:
1. Unified typology system (standardize "menhir," "dolmen," "cromlechs" terms)
2. Spatial database of megalith-grove pairs
3. OSL dating program for select sites (establish chronology)
4. Oral history documentation (urgent, elderly custodians aging)

**Estimated cost**: ₹40-60 lakhs (multi-state survey)
**Timeframe**: 3-5 years

### 13.3 Andaman Oral Archive Digitization

**Current status**: Abbi's recordings (14,000+ pages) partially digitized; institutional archiving incomplete

**Priority actions**:
1. Complete digitization of audio archives
2. Community-controlled access protocols
3. Educational curriculum development (return knowledge to schools)
4. Intergenerational transmission programs (if community desires)

**Ethical requirement**: Community consent and benefit-sharing mandatory
**Estimated cost**: ₹15-20 lakhs (digitization, community consultation)
**Timeframe**: 2 years

**Confidence Level: Gaps are H confidence; funding/political will uncertain**

## 14. Pedagogical Applications: Teaching Deep Time

### 14.1 Venue vs. Score as Classroom Framework

**Utility for history education**:

Traditional approach:
- "Ancient Indians practiced these rituals" (presents past as static, exotic)

Venue vs. Score approach:
- "Communities coordinated seasonally using these venues (stones, groves); specific rituals evolved but coordination function persisted"

**Benefit**: Students understand **functional continuity** without essentializing "timeless Indian wisdom." Emphasizes adaptation and problem-solving rather than tradition-as-stasis.

### 14.2 Oral History Projects in Local Schools

**Model program** (Meghalaya 2015-2018):
- Students interview elders about megalith histories
- Record oral traditions digitally
- Create community maps showing stone-grove-spring relationships
- Present findings at school festivals

**Outcomes**:
- Increased youth engagement with customary law systems
- Elders report feeling valued as knowledge holders
- Documented 200+ previously unrecorded oral traditions

**Scalability**: Requires training teachers in ethnographic ethics (consent, representation)
**Cost**: Minimal (digital recorders, teacher workshops)

**Confidence Level: H** *(Pilot programs successful; scalability proven)*

## 15. Conclusion: Stone as Infrastructure for Memory

### 15.1 Summary of Findings

This article has examined **six major site complexes** and **three regional systems** demonstrating how material venues (stone, sound, space) anchor ritual performances across millennia:

**Archaeological sites**:
- Kupgal (Karnataka): Acoustic rocks + petroglyphs = performance landscape (H)
- Daraki-Chattān (MP): Deep time cupules, function uncertain (M/L)
- Edakkal (Kerala): Trade corridor palimpsest, pilgrimage continuity (M)

**Living systems**:
- Nartiang (Meghalaya): Megalith-grove lawscape (H)
- Mawphlang (Meghalaya): Water governance via taboo systems (H)
- Sundarbans (Bengal): Cyclone memory in shrine placement + folk drama (M/H)

**Comparative frameworks**:
- Khasi-Kodagu-Malabar lawscape variants
- Kupgal-Wāngalā acoustic continuities
- Andaman oral archives (transmission in crisis)

### 15.2 The Venue vs. Score Distinction as Methodological Contribution

The **Venue/Score framework** provides a methodologically rigorous alternative to:
- **Essentialist claims** ("unchanged since Vedic times")
- **Rupture narratives** ("Aryans displaced indigenous traditions")
- **Romantic indigeneity** ("timeless ecological wisdom")

Instead, we document:
- **Functional persistence**: Practices continue when they solve persistent problems (water management, seasonal coordination, legal infrastructure)
- **Adaptive evolution**: Scores (rituals) evolve while venues (stones, groves) provide stable reference points
- **Hybrid systems**: Contemporary practice blends customary law, state governance, and ecological science

### 15.3 Future Directions

Three methodological frontiers:

**1. Interdisciplinary integration**:
- Acoustic archaeology + ethnomusicology
- Spatial analysis (GIS) + customary law documentation
- Ecological metrics + ritual studies

**2. Community-centered research**:
- Collaborative projects with indigenous knowledge holders
- Benefit-sharing protocols for research outcomes
- Educational return (archives, curriculum materials)

**3. Deep time pedagogy**:
- Teaching cultural continuity without essentialism
- Connecting geological time scales to social history
- Recognizing adaptation and problem-solving as continuous processes

**Final thought**: Stone is not merely symbol—it is **infrastructure for memory**. Megaliths encode law spatially. Ringing rocks amplify coordination temporally. Sacred groves protect water materially. Together, these venues enable communities to transmit knowledge across generations, adapting scores to changing conditions while maintaining functional continuity.

The *longue durée* of Janajāti memory is not mythic stasis—it is pragmatic persistence. And persistence, as Fernand Braudel taught us, is history's most radical act[^26].
