# Methodological Framework: Venue vs. Score

## Core Distinction

### VENUE
Material infrastructure that persists across generations:
- Stone sites (petroglyphs, megaliths, cupules)
- Acoustic spaces (ringing rocks, resonant chambers)
- Grove boundaries and springheads
- Coastal shrines

### SCORE
Ritual performances that evolve while maintaining structural grammar:
- Drum vocabularies (Wāngalā Dama, gōṭul percussion)
- Step sequences and choreography
- First-fruits protocols
- Vow cycles and taboos

## Cultural Ecology Rationale
Ritual as work with measurable ecological effects:
- Water retention in sacred groves
- Biodiversity conservation through taboos
- Harvest timing synchronized with monsoons
- Risk management (cyclone ethics, flood mitigation)

## Chain of Custody for Claims
1. **Assertion:** Scholarly claim or oral tradition
2. **Attestation:** Supporting evidence (archaeology, ethnography, text)
3. **Anchor:** Independent validation (OSL dating, ecological metrics, multi-site patterns)

## Evidence Grading Rubric
- **H:** Convergence across 3+ domains (archaeology + ethnography + ecology + text)
- **M:** Strong in 1-2 domains, suggestive in others
- **L:** Single-domain evidence or preliminary patterns
- **D:** Decline to time-lock (oral tradition without independent dating)

## Counter-Positions (Scholarly Humility)
- **Taphonomy:** Multiple pathways can produce similar outcomes
- **Equifinality:** Similar results ≠ identical processes
- **Dating Humility:** OSL ±10-20%, oral traditions resist exact dating
- **Text-Stratum Dialogue:** Correlation ≠ identity (e.g., Hastināpura flood)

## Comparative Framework
**Structural Rhyme vs. Lineage:**
- Avoid essentialist claims of "pristine survival"
- Document functional persistence (grammar of place-keeping)
- Acknowledge evolution and hybridization
- Seek structural patterns across unrelated sites

## Application Across Cases
This framework enables rigorous analysis of cultural continuity without:
- Romantic primitivism
- False claims of unbroken descent
- Genetic fallacies in cultural interpretation
- Anachronistic projection

Instead it focuses on:
- Functional homologies
- Ecological affordances
- Material persistence + performance evolution
- Multi-evidence triangulation
