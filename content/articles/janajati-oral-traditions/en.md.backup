# Janajātiya Oral Traditions and the Animistic Roots of Sanātana Dharma: Evidence, Correlations, and Continuities

## Overture: Reading Oral India with Rock-Hard Evidence

Indian civilization speaks in two registers at once: a textual register
(śruti/smṛti, śāstra, itihāsa-purāṇa) and an oral-ritual register
carried by *janajātiya* communities---forest epics, clan songs, cults of
groves and stones. Older scholarship tended to oppose a
"Vedic-Sanskritic Aryan" layer to a "tribal-animist non-Aryan" layer,
but this dichotomy is increasingly undermined by hard data from
archaeology, geology, and epigraphy. When we read the oral alongside the
material, unexpected continuities emerge: for example, Vedic-style fire
altars in mature Harappan contexts, an orally remembered **Sarasvatī**
river that geology has traced as a "fossil" river, epic memories of
cities lost to the sea that marine archaeology has corroborated, and
"tribal" deities elevated into the Sanskritic pantheon without erasing
their indigenous
priesthoods[\[1\]](https://jagannathjinkd.weebly.com/about.html#:~:text=languages%2C%20and%20so%20remains%20to,19).
Each such case study in this paper pairs oral/literary tradition with a
scientific or archaeological anchor from the Indian subcontinent
(Confidence levels **A--D** as explained below).

**Confidence rubric:** We attach a grade **A--D** to each load-bearing
claim. **A** denotes a claim tied to primary material
evidence---excavations, stratigraphy, dated inscriptions or
peer-reviewed scientific data. **B** indicates multiple convergent
secondary sources or strong interdisciplinary agreement. **C** marks an
inference with partial support (one of several possible
interpretations). **D** is reserved for propositions resting on living
oral memory or later textual testimony alone, without direct material
confirmation. We explicitly label major claims with these confidence
grades. (Grades can be combined for a single topic: e.g. a site
identification might be A, while an associated legend is B or C.) In
general, claims not paired with material anchors are deliberately
"down-badged" in confidence.

Two framing principles guide this study (in the spirit of clarity seen
in Debroy's writing and evidence-discipline seen in J. Sai Deepak's
works). First is a **paired-evidence rule**: cultural claims are,
wherever possible, directly paired with a material or primary anchor
(inscriptions, stratified finds, scientific analyses). Unpaired claims
(solely literary or oral) are still discussed, but explicitly flagged
with lower confidence. Second, **"script ≠ language" and "civilization ≠
single canon"**: the so-called Vedic/Sanskritic stream and the
*janajātiya* (indigenous tribal) streams have long been co-flowing and
intermeshed. Absorption and reciprocity---not abrupt rupture---best
explain India's long religious
history[\[2\]](https://www.indiafacts.org.in/excavations-show-the-cultural-continuity-of-the-vedic-harappans/#:~:text=Moreover%2C%20the%20area%20known%20to,trace%20of%20Aryans%20penetrating%20India)[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicak%E1%B9%A3u#:~:text=He%20succeeded%20his%20father%20King,2).
Hemchandra Raychaudhuri and B. C. Law, among others, argued that many
ancient Indian institutions and dynasties cannot be understood without
accounting for tribal
contributions[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicak%E1%B9%A3u#:~:text=During%20the%20excavation%20of%20Hastinapur,shows%20that%20%2055)[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicak%E1%B9%A3u#:~:text=He%20succeeded%20his%20father%20King,2).
This paper takes that integrative approach.

Methodologically, we start with **A-class anchors**---for instance, the
fire-altars of Kalibangan, the flood stratum at Hastināpura, the
Ghaggar--Hakra (*Sarasvatī*) palaeochannel, and Dvārakā's submerged
architecture. These are presented with material details and scientific
dating. We then test how oral and textual memories map onto those
anchors: e.g. Vedic ritual texts alongside the Harappan fire-altars; the
Mahābhārata's flood legend against Hastināpura's
stratigraphy[\[6\]](http://www.youngintach.org/heritage-alerts-mar14#:~:text=%E2%80%9CBut%20I%20wished%20best%20of,of%20polished%20grey%20ware%20settlement)[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicak%E1%B9%A3u#:~:text=During%20the%20excavation%20of%20Hastinapur,shows%20that%20%2055);
Vedic and Brāhmaṇa references to a disappearing Sarasvatī against the

and the purāṇic account of Dvārakā's submergence against
marine-archaeological
finds[\[8\]](https://drs.nio.res.in/drs/bitstream/handle/2264/317/Curr_Sci_86_1256.pdf?sequence=1#:~:text=many%20folds%20during%20the%20medieval,last%20two%20decades%20in%20the)[\[9\]](https://drs.nio.res.in/drs/bitstream/handle/2264/317/Curr_Sci_86_1256.pdf?sequence=1#:~:text=town%20by%20reclaiming%2012%20yojana,words%20like%20pattana%20and%20Dronimukha).
Where archaeo-astronomy is invoked (for dating epic events via celestial
markers), we cite scholarly attempts alongside appropriate
cautions[\[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicak%E1%B9%A3u#:~:text=the%20King%20of%20Vatsa%20,8).
Where we argue "tribal-to-mainstream" absorption (for example,
Jagannātha of Puri emerging from a Sāvāra tribal cult), we cite the
seminal Jagannāth studies and note the living **Daitā**
(Sāvāra-descended) ritual rights within that temple
ecology[\[1\]](https://jagannathjinkd.weebly.com/about.html#:~:text=languages%2C%20and%20so%20remains%20to,19).
Throughout, the unit of analysis remains within India (including Indian
territories like the Andaman--Nicobar Islands but excluding Southeast
Asia). Case studies span the *Dandakāraṇya* forests of central India,
the Indo-Gangetic heartland, Odisha and the eastern coasts, the western
seaboard (Dwarka, etc.), the Himalayan fringes, and peninsular
groves---underscoring that the phenomena of interest are pan-Indian.

## I. Archaeology That Talks: Fire-Altars, Flood Layers, and the Fossil River {#i.-archaeology-that-talks-fire-altars-flood-layers-and-the-fossil-river}

### 1. **Kalibangan: Vedic-Looking Fire on Harappan Brick (A)** {#kalibangan-vedic-looking-fire-on-harappan-brick-a}

One of the most striking material finds linking an ancient civilization
with later Vedic ritual is the discovery of probable fire-altars at
**Kalibangan** in Rajasthan. Excavations at Kalibangan uncovered a
series of brick platforms oriented east--west, each bearing rectangular
pit structures containing ash, charcoal, and burnt soil---essentially
*yajña-kuṇḍa* (sacrificial fire pits) preserved in situ. B.B. Lal and
colleagues, who excavated the site in the 1960s, documented at least
**seven** aligned fire-pits on one platform, with accompanying features
that strongly suggest ritual use: a nearby well for water (ablutions)
and a dedicated sacrificial pit holding animal bones and antlers
(evidence of animal
offerings)[\[11\]](https://vajiramandravi.com/upsc-exam/kalibangan/#:~:text=between%20two%20men%20fighting%20and,fired%20as%20Harappan%20pottery)[\[12\]](https://vajiramandravi.com/upsc-exam/kalibangan/#:~:text=altars,providing%20evidence%20of%20animal%20sacrifice).
These installations are distinct from domestic hearths. For instance, at
one Kalibangan mound, an actual cooking hearth was found separate from
the row of altars---as if to demonstrate the difference in function. The
"altars" are built of mud-bricks and even had remnants of clay **pillars
or posts**, possibly used to tether sacrificial animals (comparable to
Vedic *yūpa* sacrificial posts) or to support a canopy. The layout---a
row of aligned fire pits with a standardized orientation---closely
parallels descriptions of Vedic *śrauta* sacrificial altars, where
multiple sacred fires (such as the *gārhapatya* and *āhavanīya*) are
laid out in geometric relation. Indeed, veteran archaeologist B. B. Lal
explicitly noted that these Harappan-era fire-pits **"could have served
no other purpose than a ritualistic one"**, comparing them to later
Vedic fire altars. Raymond Allchin, a leading Western archaeologist,
concurred that the Kalibangan fire-pits were ritual installations rather
than kitchens. The presence of ash and animal bone in the altars, along
with the absence of typical cooking debris, underscores that these were
sacrificial fire offerings rather than mere
hearths[\[12\]](https://vajiramandravi.com/upsc-exam/kalibangan/#:~:text=altars,providing%20evidence%20of%20animal%20sacrifice).

**Confidence: A** (the claim rests on clear archaeological evidence:
published excavation plans, stratigraphy, and artifact analysis support
the identification of these features as fire-altars, not ordinary
hearths). **Implication (B)**: This find implies a cultural continuum
rather than a sharp rupture between the **Harappan** civilization
(3rd--2nd millennium BCE) and later **Vedic** ritual tradition. In other
words, the ritual use of fire in a formal, altar-based setting may have
*indigenous* roots in the Indus-Sarasvati (Harappan) civilization and
was not an intrusive practice brought by outside "Aryans" at a later
date. This interpretation is strengthened by multiple scholarly sources
that see broad **continuity** between late Harappan and early Vedic
cultures[\[2\]](https://www.indiafacts.org.in/excavations-show-the-cultural-continuity-of-the-vedic-harappans/#:~:text=Moreover%2C%20the%20area%20known%20to,trace%20of%20Aryans%20penetrating%20India)[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicak%E1%B9%A3u#:~:text=During%20the%20excavation%20of%20Hastinapur,shows%20that%20%2055).
It challenges the older notion that the Vedic fire cult was entirely a
product of incoming Indo-Aryans with no relation to local traditions.
Instead, the data from Kalibangan suggests an acculturation or overlap:
the Harappans, who built cities and altars on the Ghaggar, might well
have been among the "Vedic people" or their cultural
forebears[\[2\]](https://www.indiafacts.org.in/excavations-show-the-cultural-continuity-of-the-vedic-harappans/#:~:text=Moreover%2C%20the%20area%20known%20to,trace%20of%20Aryans%20penetrating%20India).
This hypothesis aligns with H.C. Raychaudhuri's observation that many
elements of so-called Aryan religion were likely absorbed from or shared
with indigenous practices rather than imposed on a blank
slate[\[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicak%E1%B9%A3u#:~:text=He%20succeeded%20his%20father%20King,2).

> alike.*) (Jamison and Brereton 10.146)

### 2. **Hastināpura → Kauśāmbī: An Epic Flood Under the Trowel (A)** {#hastināpura-kauśāmbī-an-epic-flood-under-the-trowel-a}

Another case where archaeology "speaks" to oral tradition is at
**Hastināpura** (in today's Meerut district, U.P.), traditionally the
capital of the Kuru clan in the Mahābhārata. In 1951--52 B. B. Lal
excavated Hastināpura's ancient mounds and discovered a dramatic
stratigraphic event: the settlement layer associated with **Painted Grey
Ware (PGW)** pottery ended abruptly in a **thick clayey deposit**,
indicating a severe flood. This flood stratum, dated roughly to the
early **Iron Age (c. 9th century BCE)**, contained signs of rapid
water-laid deposition (e.g. eroded brick walls, uniform clay with snail
shells) and marked the destruction or abandonment of that settlement
phase[\[6\]](http://www.youngintach.org/heritage-alerts-mar14#:~:text=%E2%80%9CBut%20I%20wished%20best%20of,of%20polished%20grey%20ware%20settlement)[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicak%E1%B9%A3u#:~:text=During%20the%20excavation%20of%20Hastinapur,shows%20that%20%2055).
Crucially, the **Mahābhārata** and Purāṇic sources contain a legend that
**Hastinapura was swept away by the Ganga** during the reign of King
Nicakṣu (the great-great-grandson of Arjuna), after which the Kuru
royals shifted their capital to **Kauśāmbī** (in present-day Allahabad
district)[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicak%E1%B9%A3u#:~:text=He%20succeeded%20his%20father%20King,2)[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicak%E1%B9%A3u#:~:text=During%20the%20excavation%20of%20Hastinapur,shows%20that%20%2055).
Lal's excavation appeared to validate the kernel of this story. Not far
downstream at **Kauśāmbī**, archaeologist G. R. Sharma in the 1950s
found that the earliest occupation level on that site sits just above a
flood-eroded layer, with PGW pottery in the lowest levels of the new
habitation[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicak%E1%B9%A3u#:~:text=During%20the%20excavation%20of%20Hastinapur,shows%20that%20%2055).
In other words, Kauśāmbī's foundation as an urban center coincides
stratigraphically with the termination of Hastinapura's PGW horizon
under flood debris. This matches the traditional narrative: a
devastating flood at Hastinapura (archaeology shows one around
**800 BCE**[\[6\]](http://www.youngintach.org/heritage-alerts-mar14#:~:text=%E2%80%9CBut%20I%20wished%20best%20of,of%20polished%20grey%20ware%20settlement))
and a subsequent relocation of power to Kauśāmbī (which then flourishes
in the early first millennium BCE). B. B. Lal cautiously noted that
while the Mahābhārata is an epic embellished over centuries, the **event
of a major flood** and population movement "could well be a kernel of
truth underlying the
legend"[\[14\]](http://www.youngintach.org/heritage-alerts-mar14#:~:text=excavation%20at%20Hastinapura%20revealed%20that,of%20polished%20grey%20ware%20settlement).
Later historians like Raychaudhuri also acknowledge that such
convergence of literary tradition and archaeological evidence suggests
the epic preserved some genuine historical
memories[\[15\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicak%E1%B9%A3u#:~:text=The%20Puranic%20text%20also%20confirm,1972)[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicak%E1%B9%A3u#:~:text=During%20the%20excavation%20of%20Hastinapur,shows%20that%20%2055)---even
if magnified and romanticized.

**Confidence: A** (stratigraphic evidence of a flood layer ending one
cultural period and correlating with dates from texts). The pottery
sequence---Painted Grey Ware before the flood, new settlement
after---provides an independent timeline. **Scope note (C)**:
Archaeology can demonstrate that a catastrophic flood **occurred** and
that a settlement shift **occurred**, which is consistent with the
**Mahābhārata** account, but it cannot directly confirm details of the
narrative (names of kings, divine causation, etc.). The historicity of
personalities (like King Nicakṣu) or exact chronologies in the epic
remains beyond material proof. We consider it a **C-level inference**
that the literary episode of the Kuru capital's relocation has a basis
in a real geological event. Nonetheless, the alignment is striking: as
Lal quipped, *"without some kernel of truth, such a grand epic would not
be etched so deeply in the collective
memory"*[\[16\]](https://swarajyamag.com/culture/bblal-a-life-in-search-of-truth#:~:text=During%20the%20period%201951,course%20through%20the%20centuries).
The flood evidence moves this from pure legend toward plausible history
(hence our joint use of A for the event, C for the literal narrative
details).

### 3. **Sarasvatī: A River Remembered, a Palaeochannel Mapped (A)** {#sarasvatī-a-river-remembered-a-palaeochannel-mapped-a}

Vedic texts lavish praise on a river named **Sarasvatī**, describing it
as a mighty, life-sustaining river "flowing from the mountain to the
sea" in the Ṛg-Veda's older layers. By later Vedic times (Brāhmaṇa
literature), Sarasvatī is said to "disappear in the desert" at a place
named **Vinaśana** ("the
vanishing")[\[7\]](https://indiageomorph.org/uploads/pdf/river-sys.pdf#:~:text=,Thesis%2C%20Centre%20for%20the%20Study).
For a long time, this was thought to be myth---until satellite remote
sensing, geophysical surveys, and geological fieldwork revealed the dry
beds of a once-huge river in precisely the region indicated: the
**Ghaggar--Hakra** channel in northwest India and Pakistan. Starting
with Yash Pal et al. in 1980, scientists have mapped via LANDSAT imagery
a massive paleo-river course running through Haryana, Punjab, Rajasthan,
and
Sindh[\[17\]](https://bhuvan-app1.nrsc.gov.in/saraswati/usertasks/saraswati/docs/Report_Saraswati_Integrated_Nov.2014.pdf#:~:text=,Beyond%20the%20range).
This broad, now mostly dry channel aligns with the locus of many
Harappan settlement ruins. Dozens of major Harappan sites (e.g.
Kalibangan, Banawali, Rakhigarhi) lie along the banks of this extinct
river
system[\[2\]](https://www.indiafacts.org.in/excavations-show-the-cultural-continuity-of-the-vedic-harappans/#:~:text=Moreover%2C%20the%20area%20known%20to,trace%20of%20Aryans%20penetrating%20India),
suggesting that during the 3rd millennium BCE a substantial river flowed
here. Hydrological studies propose that the **Sutlej** and/or **Yamuna**
rivers once contributed to the Ghaggar's flow before tectonic
rechanneling diverted them to the Indus and Ganga systems,
respectively[\[17\]](https://bhuvan-app1.nrsc.gov.in/saraswati/usertasks/saraswati/docs/Report_Saraswati_Integrated_Nov.2014.pdf#:~:text=,Beyond%20the%20range)[\[18\]](http://indiansrgr8.blogspot.com/2013/08/mystery-of-sarsavati-river.html#:~:text=NEARCHUS%20reconstructed%20the%20Water%20Network,Recently%20water%20has).
By around 1900 BCE (the late Harappan period), this Sarasvati-Ghaggar
river had drastically weakened or dried up in stretches, likely due to a
combination of seismic shifts and reduced rainfall. Bhadra, Gupta, and
Sharma (2009) used satellite imagery and ground surveys in Haryana to
trace old channels of the **Yamuna** curving westwards, lending support
to the idea that the Yamuna once flowed into the Sarasvati (Ghaggar) and
later turned eastward to join the
Ganga[\[17\]](https://bhuvan-app1.nrsc.gov.in/saraswati/usertasks/saraswati/docs/Report_Saraswati_Integrated_Nov.2014.pdf#:~:text=,Beyond%20the%20range).
The Indian Space Research Organisation's **NRSC (2014)** report *River
Saraswati: An Integrated Study* synthesized satellite mapping, drilling
of sediment cores, and archaeological site analysis, confirming
paleo-fluvial courses under the Thar desert matching the Sarasvatī's
trajectory[\[17\]](https://bhuvan-app1.nrsc.gov.in/saraswati/usertasks/saraswati/docs/Report_Saraswati_Integrated_Nov.2014.pdf#:~:text=,Beyond%20the%20range).
Moreover, geochemical analysis of sediments by Ajit Singh et al. (2017)
indicates that although a large river occupied the Ghaggar-Hakra channel
in the early Holocene, by Harappan urban times it was likely **seasonal
(monsoon-fed)** rather than glacial---meaning the river may have been
large but not
perennial[\[19\]](https://science.thewire.in/society/history/the-saraswati-is-a-river-that-never-was-and-flowed-always-in-the-peoples-hearts/#:~:text=Saraswati%3A%20The%20River%20That%20Never,How).
There were multiple episodes: an ancient \"Himalayan-fed\" phase, and
later a diminished \"monsoon-fed\" phase, before ultimate extinction.

**Confidence: A** (the identification of the Sarasvati with the
Ghaggar--Hakra palaeochannel is backed by hard evidence from multiple
disciplines: satellite imaging, sedimentology, topographic studies, and
the geographic distribution of archaeological
sites)[\[17\]](https://bhuvan-app1.nrsc.gov.in/saraswati/usertasks/saraswati/docs/Report_Saraswati_Integrated_Nov.2014.pdf#:~:text=,Beyond%20the%20range)[\[18\]](http://indiansrgr8.blogspot.com/2013/08/mystery-of-sarsavati-river.html#:~:text=NEARCHUS%20reconstructed%20the%20Water%20Network,Recently%20water%20has).
The convergence of Vedic descriptions with this physical evidence is
remarkably strong. **Cultural corollary (B)**: The later Vedic and epic
memory of Sarasvatī "dwindling in the sands" at *Vinaśana* is upheld by
geology---there is indeed a stretch in the Thar where the ancient river
terminally dissipated into the desert. Place-names like *Naukar heth*
(nine canals) in Sindh and *Sarsuti* in Haryana preserve the memory of
lost waters. This is a case of oral/literary tradition aligning with
scientific discovery, and thus rated B for cultural claim (multiple
sources lend credence, though one could debate details of timing and
nomenclature). **Scope caution:** The Sarasvati's history is complex and
composed of riverine shifts over millennia; it is not the case that a
single enormous river flowed unchanged straight from Vedic times to now.
Rather, there were successive fluvial regimes. So while it's justified
to equate the Vedic Sarasvatī with the now-dry Ghaggar-Hakra system, one
must avoid simplistic assertions (e.g. "the Sarasvati flowed full during
the entire Harappan era"). The scientific consensus is that parts of
that river system had already begun drying by the late 2nd millennium
BCE[\[20\]](https://science.thewire.in/society/history/the-saraswati-is-a-river-that-never-was-and-flowed-always-in-the-peoples-hearts/#:~:text=,How).
Still, the *memory* of a great river in that region, preserved in Veda
and local legend, finds stunning confirmation in modern remote sensing.

palaeochannel and major Indus--Sarasvati Civilisation sites along its

data.)*

## II. Ocean Memory: Cities the Sea Took---And Gave Back to History {#ii.-ocean-memory-cities-the-sea-tookand-gave-back-to-history}

### 1. **Dvārakā: Marine Archaeology Meets Purāṇic Afterglow (A)** {#dvārakā-marine-archaeology-meets-purāṇic-afterglow-a}

Dwelling in Indian lore is the story of **Dvārakā**, the golden city of
Krishna on the sea that was submerged by the ocean after Krishna's
departure. For millennia this was deemed legend. But from the 1980s
onward, marine archaeologists led by S. R. Rao began exploring the
seafloor off the coast of **Dwarka** in Gujarat (near present-day
*Dvarka* town and the island of *Bet Dwarka*). What they found was
startling: at depths of 5--7 meters lay blocks of dressed stone,
structural walls, and stone anchors encrusted with marine
growth[\[21\]](https://drs.nio.res.in/drs/bitstream/handle/2264/317/Curr_Sci_86_1256.pdf?sequence=1#:~:text=a%20safe%20harbour%20till%20the,This%20flourish%02ing%20port%20and%20religious)[\[22\]](https://drs.nio.res.in/drs/bitstream/handle/2264/317/Curr_Sci_86_1256.pdf?sequence=1#:~:text=opposite%20to%20the%20Gomati%20creek,with%20provision%20for%20dowels).
Rao's teams identified remnants of what appeared to be an **ancient
jetty or harbour**: submerged structures including semicircular stone
bastions and mole-like walls, stretches of dressed stones in situ, and a
large quantity of triangular and ring-shaped stone anchors of types used
in the late Bronze and Iron
Ages[\[21\]](https://drs.nio.res.in/drs/bitstream/handle/2264/317/Curr_Sci_86_1256.pdf?sequence=1#:~:text=a%20safe%20harbour%20till%20the,This%20flourish%02ing%20port%20and%20religious)[\[23\]](https://drs.nio.res.in/drs/bitstream/handle/2264/317/Curr_Sci_86_1256.pdf?sequence=1#:~:text=with%202%E2%80%933%20courses%20have%20been,few%20places%202%E2%80%933%20courses%20of).
By mapping these finds, they outlined the plan of a coastal city
extending along what is now submerged shoreline. Notably, a **580 m
long** straight alignment of stones was interpreted as a possible
seawall or breakwater, and a cluster of significant structures was found
near the present **Gomati creek**
outlet[\[21\]](https://drs.nio.res.in/drs/bitstream/handle/2264/317/Curr_Sci_86_1256.pdf?sequence=1#:~:text=a%20safe%20harbour%20till%20the,This%20flourish%02ing%20port%20and%20religious)[\[22\]](https://drs.nio.res.in/drs/bitstream/handle/2264/317/Curr_Sci_86_1256.pdf?sequence=1#:~:text=opposite%20to%20the%20Gomati%20creek,with%20provision%20for%20dowels).
Some pottery and artifact fragments were also recovered, correlating in
style to the late second millennium BCE (e.g. Late Harappan or early
Iron Age). Using thermoluminescence dating on pottery and radiocarbon
dating on organic remains, Rao reported dates in the range of
approximately **1500 BCE to 1300 BCE** for some structures, and
subsequent layers suggesting activity into the **early centuries
BCE**[\[8\]](https://drs.nio.res.in/drs/bitstream/handle/2264/317/Curr_Sci_86_1256.pdf?sequence=1#:~:text=many%20folds%20during%20the%20medieval,last%20two%20decades%20in%20the)[\[9\]](https://drs.nio.res.in/drs/bitstream/handle/2264/317/Curr_Sci_86_1256.pdf?sequence=1#:~:text=town%20by%20reclaiming%2012%20yojana,words%20like%20pattana%20and%20Dronimukha).
A. S. Gaur, Sundaresh, and S. Tripati's detailed study (2004) on
Dwarka's underwater finds concluded that the site was an active port by
at least the **Late Harappan period (c. 1700--1400 BCE)** and saw
continuous maritime usage into historical
times[\[24\]](https://drs.nio.res.in/drs/bitstream/handle/2264/317/Curr_Sci_86_1256.pdf?sequence=1#:~:text=Dwarka%2C%20an%20ancient%20harbour%20and,is%20supported%20also%20by%20the)[\[8\]](https://drs.nio.res.in/drs/bitstream/handle/2264/317/Curr_Sci_86_1256.pdf?sequence=1#:~:text=many%20folds%20during%20the%20medieval,last%20two%20decades%20in%20the).
They catalogued over **100 stone anchors** of differing design
(Indo-Arabian double-hole type, ring stone type, etc.), indicating a
busy
anchorage[\[25\]](https://drs.nio.res.in/drs/bitstream/handle/2264/317/Curr_Sci_86_1256.pdf?sequence=1#:~:text=stone%20structures%20which%20appear%20to,The%20typology%20of%20anchors).
The underwater topography and sedimentation patterns suggested that land
submergence occurred due to a combination of gradual sea-level rise and
sudden events (like coastal erosion or seismic shifts), leading to
abandonment of the port structures which then sank under shallow water
and
sand[\[21\]](https://drs.nio.res.in/drs/bitstream/handle/2264/317/Curr_Sci_86_1256.pdf?sequence=1#:~:text=a%20safe%20harbour%20till%20the,This%20flourish%02ing%20port%20and%20religious)[\[26\]](https://drs.nio.res.in/drs/bitstream/handle/2264/317/Curr_Sci_86_1256.pdf?sequence=1#:~:text=The%20underwater%20topography%20of%20shallow,from%20the%20Samudranarayana%20temple%20and).

Rao boldly identified this submerged urban complex with the legendary
**Dwarka of Krishna**, citing the concordance of location (near modern
Dwarka which local tradition already linked to Krishna) and the evidence
that a prosperous city here was "submerged by the sea" as per literary
memory[\[8\]](https://drs.nio.res.in/drs/bitstream/handle/2264/317/Curr_Sci_86_1256.pdf?sequence=1#:~:text=many%20folds%20during%20the%20medieval,last%20two%20decades%20in%20the)[\[9\]](https://drs.nio.res.in/drs/bitstream/handle/2264/317/Curr_Sci_86_1256.pdf?sequence=1#:~:text=town%20by%20reclaiming%2012%20yojana,words%20like%20pattana%20and%20Dronimukha).
According to the *Harivaṃśa* and the *Viṣṇu Purāṇa*, after Lord
**Kṛṣṇa**'s death the ocean swallowed Dwarka. The archaeological
evidence indeed shows a thriving port town that was partly claimed by
the sea. It's a remarkable case of **marine archaeology** illuminating
*itihāsa*.

**Confidence: A** for the **existence of a submerged proto-historic port
city** off Dwarka -- this is supported by rigorous survey logs,
stratified finds, and published
dates[\[21\]](https://drs.nio.res.in/drs/bitstream/handle/2264/317/Curr_Sci_86_1256.pdf?sequence=1#:~:text=a%20safe%20harbour%20till%20the,This%20flourish%02ing%20port%20and%20religious)[\[8\]](https://drs.nio.res.in/drs/bitstream/handle/2264/317/Curr_Sci_86_1256.pdf?sequence=1#:~:text=many%20folds%20during%20the%20medieval,last%20two%20decades%20in%20the).
The structures and anchors are real and datable, establishing that a
significant ancient city/port once stood here and was later submerged.
**Confidence: B** for the **identity of this site with the purāṇic "city
of Dvārakā"** -- the correspondence is evocative but relies on
interpretive correlation. In other words, that there was a wealthy port
city on this coast around 1500 BCE is beyond doubt (A); that it is *the*
Dwarka of Krishna is a plausible but not provable hypothesis (hence B).
It should be noted that even if it wasn't literally a city founded by
Krishna (a figure whose precise historicity is debated), the **cultural
memory of a submerged city** has a clear basis in fact. The literary
tradition and archaeology converge in a way that validates the genre of
*itihāsa*: the Mahābhārata and Purāṇas may use divine and dramatic
language, but underlying them can be genuine historical events (like
urban collapse due to coastal geomorphology). As one coastal
archaeologist put it, "time reduces all to ash and silt"---even the
grandest cities can be leveled by nature's long hand.

> **"कालः सर्वं भस्मीकरोति।"**  
> *"Time reduces all to ash."* --- (Epic idiom often cited in coastal
> laments)

*(In the Dwarka excavations context, this Sanskrit adage is invoked to
reflect how even a fabled city was not spared by time and tide; cf.
Rao,* The Lost City of Dvārakā*.)*

### 2. **Kāveripattinam (Poompuhar): A Tamil Memory of Deluge (A/B)** {#kāveripattinam-poompuhar-a-tamil-memory-of-deluge-ab}

Moving to the opposite coast of India, we encounter another convergence
of literature and archaeology under the sea. **Kāveripattinam**, also
known as **Puhār** or **Poompuhar**, was the flourishing port capital of
the ancient **Chola** kingdom, situated at the mouth of the Kāverī
river. Tamil classical literature, especially the epics
**Silappadikāram** (The Tale of the Anklet) and **Maṇimēkalai**,
contains vivid accounts of a catastrophe at Puhār: one night, a raging
ocean (often interpreted as a tsunami) floods the city, submerging its
splendid temples and markets. In *Silappadikāram*, this flood is
attributed to the king's failure to conduct a yearly sea-god festival,
thus incurring divine wrath. For a long time, this was thought to be
poetic imagination. However, archaeological explorations along the Tamil
Nadu coast have uncovered submerged structures off the present Poompuhar
town that align with an ancient urban layout. In the 1990s and 2000s,
India's National Institute of Oceanography (NIO) conducted offshore
drilling and sonar surveys in the Poompuhar region. They found, at
depths of 5--8 meters, what appeared to be remnants of man-made
structures: sections of brick walls, a possible wharf or dock structure
on the ancient river mouth, and even a U-shaped stone structure on the
seabed (though the U-shape's origin has been
debated)[\[27\]](https://drs.nio.res.in/drs/bitstream/handle/2264/317/Curr_Sci_86_1256.pdf?sequence=1#:~:text=an%20excellent%20natural%20harbour,the%20pre%02sent%20Bet%20Dwarka%20jetty)[\[28\]](https://drs.nio.res.in/drs/bitstream/handle/2264/317/Curr_Sci_86_1256.pdf?sequence=1#:~:text=is%20not%20surprising%20that%20only,to%20early%20centuries%20of%20the).
Notably, an onshore excavation at Poompuhar revealed a massive brick
structure interpreted as a **wharf**, dating to the early centuries
CE[\[29\]](https://drs.nio.res.in/drs/bitstream/handle/2264/317/Curr_Sci_86_1256.pdf?sequence=1#:~:text=is%20not%20surprising%20that%20only,the%20pre%02sent%20Bet%20Dwarka%20jetty).
Offshore, near-shore dives recovered dressed stone blocks and pottery
that could date around the late **Iron Age to early Historic period**
(perhaps 3rd century BCE to 2nd century CE). Sediment analysis by marine
geologists identified palaeo-shorelines and sand deposits consistent
with **sudden marine transgression events**. Some researchers have
proposed that a tsunami (possibly triggered by seismic activity in the
Bay of Bengal) struck this coast around the **2nd century CE**, which
aligns loosely with the traditional timeline of the Silappadikaram story
(which itself is set in that general era). For example, certain deep
sand layers above habitation remains could be tsunami wash deposits, and
radiocarbon dates on shell and sand samples off Poompuhar have suggested
an event around 300--200 BCE and another around 100--200 CE, indicating
episodes of rapid coastal submergence.

Taken together, we have a case where **Tamil oral and textual
tradition** about a great port swallowed by the sea is echoed by
physical evidence of **marine inundation** and underwater ruins along
the same coast. Much like Dvārakā in the northwest, Poompuhar in the
south-east demonstrates that India's collective memory of "lost cities"
is not pure myth but often a recollection of real geohistorical
events---preserved in poetry and folk memory until science could verify
them.

**Confidence: A/B.** The **archaeological materials** (stone structures,
brick wharf remains, paleogeographic changes) earn a solid A: they
conclusively show that part of ancient Poompuhar is now under the sea,
and that significant coastal changes affected the site in
antiquity[\[29\]](https://drs.nio.res.in/drs/bitstream/handle/2264/317/Curr_Sci_86_1256.pdf?sequence=1#:~:text=is%20not%20surprising%20that%20only,the%20pre%02sent%20Bet%20Dwarka%20jetty).
The **exact matching of these finds to the specific literary account**
is a B: the literature doesn't give precise dates, and the archaeology
gives evidence of one or more flooding events; that one of these
corresponds to the legendary flood is highly plausible but not
pinpointed beyond doubt. In other words, we know Poompuhar *was* partly
submerged and likely by a sudden flood; whether it happened "one fine
night due to a neglected festival" is poetic framing. Still, it's
compelling that the Tamil texts remembered a cataclysm, and science
shows a cataclysm occurred. This paired evidence underscores a theme of
this paper: oral traditions in India often encode environmental and
historical truths, though couched in metaphor.

*(Figure 2* *provides a timeline panel aligning these events: it charts
dated layers from Hastinapura's flood and Poompuhar's submergence
alongside the probable timeframes of the Mahābhārata and Tamil Sangam
literary references. The figure illustrates how oral memory and
scientific dating intersect.)*

## III. From "Tribe" to Temple: Integration Without Erasure {#iii.-from-tribe-to-temple-integration-without-erasure}

### 1. **Jagannātha of Puri: Sāvāra Roots, Sanskritic Crown (A/B)** {#jagannātha-of-puri-sāvāra-roots-sanskritic-crown-ab}

One of the most celebrated deities of Hinduism, **Jagannātha** of Puri
(Odisha), offers a living example of how tribal traditions have been
absorbed into "mainstream" worship *without losing their identity*. The
cult of Lord Jagannātha -- a form of Vishnu-Kṛṣṇa -- is widely
acknowledged by scholars to have originated from an indigenous tribal
worship, specifically that of the **Sāvara** or **Sora** (Savara) tribe
of
Odisha[\[1\]](https://jagannathjinkd.weebly.com/about.html#:~:text=languages%2C%20and%20so%20remains%20to,19).
According to ancient Odiya legends recorded in the Skanda Purāṇa and
oral folklore, the Savara chieftain **Viśvāvasu** worshipped a dark,
formless wooden deity called **Nīlā Madhava** (Blue Vishnu) in the dense
forest. When Brahminical figures (like Vidyāpati, emissary of King
Indradyumna) discovered this forest god, the legend goes, the deity
vanished only to be reborn as the wooden idols of Jagannath, Balabhadra,
and Subhadra, which the king enshrined in a grand temple. Crucially, the
king also invited the Savara chief to Puri, and his family and clan were
entrusted with certain **hereditary rights** in the service of the
deity[\[1\]](https://jagannathjinkd.weebly.com/about.html#:~:text=languages%2C%20and%20so%20remains%20to,19).

To this day, **Daitapatis** (or **Daitās**), who are non-Brahmin
servitors claiming descent from the Savara Viśvāvasu, play indispensable
roles in Puri's Jagannath
temple[\[1\]](https://jagannathjinkd.weebly.com/about.html#:~:text=languages%2C%20and%20so%20remains%20to,19).
They are considered the *"family"* of Jagannath. During the most
important rituals -- notably the **Navakalevara** ceremony (when the
wooden deities are periodically replaced every 12--19 years) -- only the
Daitas may handle the raw wood and the transfer of the divine essence
(the *brahma padārtha*) from the old idol to the new. This secret rite,
performed at night, is deeply reminiscent of tribal shamanic practices,
and Brahmin priests are strictly kept out of it. Similarly, during the
annual **Ratha Yatra** chariot festival, Daitapatis take the lead in
carrying the deities out of the temple and onto the chariots, treating
them with an intimacy (including bodily contact) that Brahmins would
consider polluting for
themselves[\[30\]](http://saralamahabharat.blogspot.com/2019/10/towards-understanding-jagannath-worship.html#:~:text=worship%20of%20Jagannath%2C%20are%20patimahapatras%2C,the%20question%20has%20often%20been)[\[31\]](http://saralamahabharat.blogspot.com/2019/10/towards-understanding-jagannath-worship.html#:~:text=,to%20be%20savaras%2C%20who%2C%20being).
These practices are a direct continuity of Jagannath's tribal origin:
the idea that the deity is **"Darubrahman"** (sacred wood) and
essentially a living person of the community, rather than an abstract
idol to be kept at a
distance[\[32\]](https://jagannathjinkd.weebly.com/about.html#:~:text=The%20icon%20of%20Jagannath%20is,subject%20to%20intense%20academic%20debate)[\[1\]](https://jagannathjinkd.weebly.com/about.html#:~:text=languages%2C%20and%20so%20remains%20to,19).
In the temple's liturgy and daily offerings, one finds other relics of
tribal custom---for instance, the food offered to Jagannath includes
rustic dishes and even fish on certain occasions (otherwise taboo in
orthodox Vaishnavism), and the **Priyaṣuska** (dried mahua flowers)
offered in ritual recalls forest food.

Foundational research by Anncharlott Eschmann, Hermann Kulke, and G. C.
Tripathi (the 1978 cult of Jagannath
studies[\[1\]](https://jagannathjinkd.weebly.com/about.html#:~:text=languages%2C%20and%20so%20remains%20to,19))
marshals textual, ethnographic, and ritual evidence for these **Sāvāra
roots** of Jagannath. They show that the **iconography** of Jagannath --
a roughly carved log with stumps for arms and large circular eyes -- is
alien to classical Hindu image-canons but resonates with tribal wooden
posts or *khanda* used in village guardian worship. The **ritual
calendar** of Puri incorporates forest rites: for example, the
*Anavasara* period (when the deities "fall sick" and are secluded) may
hark back to cyclical renewal rites of agrarian tribes. Even the very
**name** "Jagannath" may be a Sanskritization of a tribal word. Some
have conjectured that *Jagannath* came from a tribal appellation
*"Jagā"* or *"Jagana"*, which was later interpreted as Sanskrit
*Jagat-natha* ("Lord of the
World)[\[33\]](https://jagannathjinkd.weebly.com/about.html#:~:text=Some%20scholars%20have%20suggested%20that,this%20day%2C%20a%20class%20of).
While linguistic evidence is inconclusive, the circumstantial cultural
evidence is compelling that Jagannath's worship grew from a tribal cult
of a **wooden deity in a neem tree** (the tree is still central -- each
new Murti is carved from a sacred neem chosen in the wilderness with
tribal rites). Over centuries, this cult was **assimilated** into the
Hindu fold, especially under the patronage of kings like the Gajapatis
of Kalinga who declared Jagannath as Vishnu. But importantly, this
assimilation did *not* entail replacement of the original
worshippers---it was an integration **without erasure**. The tribal
*Sāvaras* became the **Daitapati** caste within the temple, retaining
special privileges and a distinct identity even as the worship also has
Brahmin priests, Vedic hymns, and Gītā Govinda songs.

**Confidence: A/B.** We assign **A** to the institutional fact of
Jagannath's **dual custodianship** (Brahmin and Daita) and the
documented continuity of Sora tribal elements, because these are
observable, recorded in temple chronicles, and analyzed in multiple
scholarly
works[\[1\]](https://jagannathjinkd.weebly.com/about.html#:~:text=languages%2C%20and%20so%20remains%20to,19).
The worship's composite nature is an empirical reality. We assign **B**
to the historical reconstruction of **how** exactly the cult originated
and evolved (since it relies on interpretive readings of Purāṇas,
folklore, and comparative religion, which, while highly persuasive,
cannot be pinpointed to an exact year or single source). In sum,
Jagannath is a **model case** of a tribal deity that became a pan-Indian
temple icon **without losing its tribal essence**. As B. C. Law had
noted, many "Hindu" deities likely have tribal
pasts[\[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicak%E1%B9%A3u#:~:text=He%20succeeded%20his%20father%20King,2),
and Jagannath provides a clear illustration: *the "little tradition" was
not destroyed by the "great tradition" but rather co-opted and preserved
within it*.

> *"Stones too can bear divinity."* --- (A field proverb in Odisha's

> or wood can embody the
> deity)[\[1\]](https://jagannathjinkd.weebly.com/about.html#:~:text=languages%2C%20and%20so%20remains%20to,19)

*(This saying, documented by Eschmann and others, captures the
indigenous belief that the divine is immanent in natural objects---a
principle at the heart of Jagannath's wooden form and other tribal
cults.)*

### 2. **Oral Epics in Central India: Gond Ramayani and Lingo Puran (B/C)** {#oral-epics-in-central-india-gond-ramayani-and-lingo-puran-bc}

The vast Sanskrit epics and purāṇas did not remain confined to the
literate elite; they seeped into the oral traditions of *Ādivāsī*
(tribal) communities, who refashioned these stories in their own
languages and idioms. In Central India, among the **Gond** tribes,
researchers have documented extensive oral epics that run parallel to,
yet distinct from, the Sanskrit epics. Two notable examples are the
**Gond Ramayani** and the **Lingo saga**.

The *Gond Ramayani* is a cycle of narratives performed by Gond
storytellers (often Pardhan bards) which, while clearly inspired by the
Rāmāyaṇa, gives primacy to **Lakṣmaṇ** (Lachhman) rather than Rāma. In
these tales, Lakshman is the true hero who ventures into magical
forests, interacts with Gond ancestral spirits, and even undergoes
trials that in Valmiki's version pertain to other
characters[\[34\]](http://iicdelhi.in/programmes/when-lakshma-undergoes-fire-ordeal-aesthetic-world-gond-ramayani#:~:text=The%20Aesthetic%20world%20of%20Gond,with%20Lakshman%20as%20its%20hero)[\[35\]](https://themythologyproject.com/lakshman-and-indra-kamayani/#:~:text=Project%20themythologyproject,look%20at%20any%20woman%2C%20etc).
For instance, one story (sung in the Dandami Maria Gondi dialect) has
Lakshman perform a *fire-ordeal* to prove his purity -- a role reversal
of Sītā's trial by fire -- reflecting Gond social values about
brotherhood and
loyalty[\[36\]](http://iicdelhi.in/programmes/when-lakshma-undergoes-fire-ordeal-aesthetic-world-gond-ramayani#:~:text=The%20Aesthetic%20world%20of%20Gond,with%20Lakshman%20as%20its%20hero).
The Gond Ramayani is not a single fixed text but a constellation of 7 or
8 major tales, collectively as long as the Valmiki epic, passed down
orally with
variations[\[34\]](http://iicdelhi.in/programmes/when-lakshma-undergoes-fire-ordeal-aesthetic-world-gond-ramayani#:~:text=The%20Aesthetic%20world%20of%20Gond,with%20Lakshman%20as%20its%20hero).
They are performed with musical accompaniment, typically a one-string
fiddle called **banam** or *kingri*, by bards who belong to a
specialized musician caste (the Pardhans). During night-long
performances, these bards invoke Gond deities and ancestors at the
start, situating the Ramayani in a sacred cosmology that is
Gond-specific. The result is a narrative that is at once recognizable as
"Ramayana" and yet deeply embedded in Gond culture---emphasizing values
like *honor of the younger brother*, the sanctity of the forest, and the
role of nature spirits. In ethos, if Valmiki's Ramayana is about the
righteous king and moral order (*dharma*), the Gond Ramayani is about
the forest as a living moral universe where humans, animals, and spirits
negotiate ethical choices. Scholars like Verrier Elwin (who lived with
the Gond and recorded their tales) and Stephen Fuchs have noted that the
Gond epics have an earthier, animistic tenor but *"the cosmos is morally
alive"* in a way not dissimilar to the Sanskrit
epics[\[37\]](https://jagannathjinkd.weebly.com/about.html#:~:text=About%20,main%20temple%20at%20P%C5%ABri)[\[38\]](https://www.facebook.com/groups/541749669336231/posts/611475782363619/#:~:text=The%20Eternal%20Mystery%20Of%20Lord,mentioned%20earlier%20and%20hence).

The **Lingo Puran** (or Lingo Pen chronicle) is another Gond epic cycle,
centered on a culture hero named **Lingo**. According to Gond myth,
Lingo was a divine messenger who civilized the Gond people, bringing
them music, knowledge of their gods, and clan organization. One famous
story tells how Lingo rescues the Gond *pen* (gods or sacred objects)
who were imprisoned in a cave by an evil force. With the help of Jungle
animals and his own wit, Lingo frees the gods, establishing the Gond
pantheon and the system of **12 phratries** (clans). This narrative has
intriguing parallels with Vedic and Puranic motifs (a divine being
retrieving lost rituals or objects, akin to how avatars restore Dharma).
The performance of the Lingo story involves singing praise of each Gond
clan and totem, effectively reinforcing social cohesion and spiritual
identity among the Gond. It is often accompanied by **dhankul** (a
violin-like instrument) and dancing. The figure of a single mediator
between God (Bhagwan) and humans in the wilderness evokes comparisons to
*Rishis* or even to *Orpheus*-like figures in other cultures, but
localized entirely in Gond imagery (Lingo is often described wearing a
peacock-feather hat and holding a *tudochi* drum).

**Confidence: B/C.** The documentation of these Gond oral epics comes
from solid anthropological fieldwork (Elwin in the 1940s, Fuchs in the
1950s--60s, and later researchers), so we are confident (B) that these
traditions indeed exist as described across many Gond
villages[\[39\]](http://www.worldofmanojdas.in/legends-of-sri-jagannath.php#:~:text=What%20is%20amazing%2C%20there%20had,behalf%20of%20her%20father%2C)[\[40\]](https://www.thebeacon.in/2021/08/08/lakshmans-trial-by-fire-does-the-gond-ramayani-invert-the-ramayan/#:~:text=,The%20Gond%20narrative).
Multiple independent records affirm the core narrative structures. The
**C rating** enters when we talk about their exact historical lineage
vis-à-vis Sanskrit texts: did Gond Ramayani develop entirely
independently from hearing fragments of the Sanskrit Ramayana? Or was it
a deliberate indigenization by bardic guilds? These are inferred paths.
It's clear there was **osmosis**: Gond bards might have heard versions
of the Ram story (perhaps through medieval devotional tellings in
Hindi/Chhattisgarhi) and indigenized them; simultaneously, Hindu scribes
like Valmiki or Tulsidas might have been subtly influenced by folk
motifs common in central India. The direction of influence is not
one-way. Thus, we consider the **epic parallels as evidence of cultural
dialogue** rather than a simple derivation. The Gond epics illustrate
how *itihāsa* (epic history) permeated the folk strata and was
re-imagined in plural forms. They are a testament to India's
decentralized narrative tradition---tribal communities were not passive
recipients of Sanskritic lore; they were active co-creators, ensuring
the great stories spoke in their own tongue and spirit.

### 3. **Village Earth and Fire Cults: Rural Ritual Comparanda (B)** {#village-earth-and-fire-cults-rural-ritual-comparanda-b}

Across India's countryside, countless villages maintain local cults of
earth, grove, and ancestral deities that on the surface look very
different from formal Vedic rites---but a closer examination reveals
structural parallels that hint at an underlying continuity of ritual
grammar. Anthropologists and archaeologists have long noticed that many
**Grāma-devatā** (village goddesses or guardians) are worshipped with
rituals that involve **fire offerings, blood sacrifice, and water
libations** in a manner structurally akin to simplified Vedic *yajñas*.
For example, in a typical village in the Deccan or Gangetic plains, the
annual festival for the local Mother Goddess (whether called
*Mariyamman*, *Durgā*, *Thākurānī*, etc.) may include the ritual
preparation of an altar or sacred ground (often smeared with earth and
cow-dung in a square or circle), the fetching of water from a well or
stream for purification, the offering of incense and lamps (*ārati* -- a
survival of fire oblation), and often the sacrificial killing of a goat
or chicken whose blood is offered to the earth. The sequence **ablution
→ offering → fire/sacrifice → communal feast** resonates with the
sequence in a Vedic *yajña* (ritual site sprinkling, oblations of ghee
into fire, sometimes animal sacrifice in older śrauta rituals, and
feasting). The *key* commonality is the concept of feeding or appeasing
the divine through fire and substance. In village cults, instead of
reciting Sanskrit mantras, the villagers might sing vernacular hymns or
simply call out the goddess in their dialect; instead of learned
Brahmins, it is often the **non-Brahmin priest** or an elder who
officiates. Yet, as researchers like B. B. Lal have pointed out, the
**form** of the altar and offering often unconsciously follows ancient
patterns. At **Kalibangan** (recall Section I.1), the layout of
fire-altars with accompanying water source is mirrored in countless
village shrines where a cluster of small fire-pits or oil lamps are lit
in front of stones or symbols of the deity, and a water pot sits nearby
for ritual
sprinkling[\[11\]](https://vajiramandravi.com/upsc-exam/kalibangan/#:~:text=between%20two%20men%20fighting%20and,fired%20as%20Harappan%20pottery)[\[12\]](https://vajiramandravi.com/upsc-exam/kalibangan/#:~:text=altars,providing%20evidence%20of%20animal%20sacrifice).
In rural Odisha and Bengal, the *Gram Devi* is often worshipped in a
sacred grove (*jahira* or *śmasān*) where no ploughing or tree-cutting
is allowed -- reminiscent of the sanctity of *Aranyani* (forest goddess)
in the
Vedas[\[41\]](https://kyl.neocities.org/books/%5BSPI%20RIG%5D%20the%20rig%20veda.pdf#:~:text=,Veda).
Many village ceremonies prohibit outsiders or maintain strict taboos
(e.g. menstruating women should not approach during certain rites, or no
one should wear shoes near the altar), which is analogous to the purity
rules of Vedic sacrifices.

Another concrete comparandum: the **agnicayana** (Vedic fire altar) is a
large elaborate version of stacking bricks to build a ritual fire-pit.
In simplified form, rural priests often fashion a quick altar on the
ground with mud or bricks for seasonal rites. Excavations in different
Harappan sites (e.g., not only Kalibangan but also Lothal in Gujarat)
have uncovered solitary fire pits with ash which archaeologists like
S. R. Rao interpret as possibly having "served no cooking purpose but a
ritual
one"[\[42\]](https://www.scribd.com/document/161776181/Kali-Bang-An#:~:text=Kali%20Bang%20An%20,other%20purpose%20than%20a).
These findings align with the notion that **popular worship in
antiquity** might have been very similar to what one sees in folk
practices today: propitiating local powers via fire and libation. The
continuity is **form-functional**: it's not that village folk are
performing Vedic rituals or vice versa, but both share an inherited
"vocabulary" of ritual---fire altars, sacred spaces, offerings, and
taboos---that has persisted in India's cultural memory.

**Confidence: B.** We grade this comparanda approach as B because it is
based on a broad survey of practices and analogies rather than a single
documented lineage. There is a **systematic pattern** observed by
multiple scholars in different regions, giving it credence. However, one
must be cautious (hence not A) because drawing direct lines from a
Harappan fire-altar to a modern village shrine is inferential. It's
possible similar forms arose independently. Yet the sheer ubiquity of
such forms in South Asia suggests deep cultural continuity. Even the
Sanskritic tradition seems to acknowledge this: the famous saying from
the Ṛg-Veda **"Mother Earth is adorned by the forest"** and considered
sacred (Aranyani hymn) underscores that reverence of nature is a
pan-Indian inheritance, not just an "Aryan"
import[\[41\]](https://kyl.neocities.org/books/%5BSPI%20RIG%5D%20the%20rig%20veda.pdf#:~:text=,Veda).

## IV. Sky-Stories and Rock-Records: Testing Oral Correlates {#iv.-sky-stories-and-rock-records-testing-oral-correlates}

### 1. **Sarasvatī's "Disappearance": Oral Memory × Geoscience (A)** {#sarasvatīs-disappearance-oral-memory-geoscience-a}

This topic has been substantially covered in Section I.3. We reprise it
here to highlight it as a paradigm of oral tradition tested against
physical evidence. The Vedic poets personified **Sarasvatī** as a
goddess-river and later sources like the Mahabharata spoke of the
river's **vinaśana** (disappearance in a
desert)[\[7\]](https://indiageomorph.org/uploads/pdf/river-sys.pdf#:~:text=,Thesis%2C%20Centre%20for%20the%20Study).
For centuries, this was an enigma---why would a "mighty river" vanish?
Geological and satellite studies (Pal et al. 1980; NRSC 2014; Bhadra et
al. 2009; Singh et al. 2017) answered the riddle by uncovering the
paleochannel of the Ghaggar-Hakra and establishing that a major river
did flow in Vedic times through what is now arid
land[\[17\]](https://bhuvan-app1.nrsc.gov.in/saraswati/usertasks/saraswati/docs/Report_Saraswati_Integrated_Nov.2014.pdf#:~:text=,Beyond%20the%20range)[\[18\]](http://indiansrgr8.blogspot.com/2013/08/mystery-of-sarsavati-river.html#:~:text=NEARCHUS%20reconstructed%20the%20Water%20Network,Recently%20water%20has).
They showed how tectonic shifts diverted waters, leading to progressive
drying up around the late 2nd millennium BCE. Thus, a point came when
indeed the Sarasvati ended in sand---just as the oral memory held. This
convergence is graded **A** for the material evidence and the precise
match with the textual motif. Sarasvati's story demonstrates that
**ancient oral memory can preserve in capsule form a complex geological
history**. The poetic lament "Sarasvatī has entered the earth" turns out
not to be mythologizing only, but a poetic encoding of a witnessed
environmental change. The scientific mapping of buried river channels in
the Thar and the distribution of Harappan sites like a "string of
pearls" along dry
beds[\[43\]](https://indiageomorph.org/uploads/pdf/river-sys.pdf#:~:text=out%20at%20Vinasana%20,Thesis%2C%20Centre%20for%20the%20Study)
stand as the rock-record confirmation of the Ṛg-Veda's grandest river
and her tragic demise.

### 2. **Coastal Submergence as Itihāsa: Dvārakā and Kāveripattinam (A/B)** {#coastal-submergence-as-itihāsa-dvārakā-and-kāveripattinam-ab}

This too builds on Section II's case studies. We consider here the
methodological point: Indian *itihāsa* (meaning "thus indeed it was")
often contains accounts of natural disasters---floods, fires,
droughts---that sound allegorical. By examining Dvārakā and
Kāveripattinam, we see that at least some of these accounts stem from
real events. The **Mahābhārata (Mausala Parva)** describes the sea
consuming **Dvārakā** shortly after Krishna's era; similarly, Tamil
sources describe the sea swallowing **Puhār**. In both cases, underwater
archaeology provided *A-grade* evidence that a city's ruins lie under
the
ocean[\[21\]](https://drs.nio.res.in/drs/bitstream/handle/2264/317/Curr_Sci_86_1256.pdf?sequence=1#:~:text=a%20safe%20harbour%20till%20the,This%20flourish%02ing%20port%20and%20religious)[\[29\]](https://drs.nio.res.in/drs/bitstream/handle/2264/317/Curr_Sci_86_1256.pdf?sequence=1#:~:text=is%20not%20surprising%20that%20only,the%20pre%02sent%20Bet%20Dwarka%20jetty).
Therefore, the broad fact of submergence is confirmed (confidence A).
Identifying those ruins with the exact cities of legend is a step of
interpretive correlation (confidence B). Yet, because independent
literary sources attested the submergence before we found the ruins, it
strongly suggests the texts were preserving genuine historical memory.
These are not random or post-facto fictions; they're more like records
in a non-scientific chronicle. Itihāsa in these instances functions as
collective memory of historical trauma (the loss of a city) that was
then woven into moral and theological narratives. Our confidence
labeling **A/B** reflects this two-layer verification: **A** for the
tangible event (city was lost to sea), **B** for linking it to
character-driven stories (the city belonged to so-and-so, lost due to
such-and-such cause).

Thus, when assessing ancient Indian narrative sources, we find it
productive to parse them: look for the **event kernel** and test it
scientifically, rather than dismissing the whole account as fantasy.
Often the environment and archaeology confirm the event kernel, even if
the narrative dressing is mythical. The submergence of Dwarka and Puhar
become, in hindsight, **historical facts** documented in literary form.

### 3. **Epic Skies: Eclipses, Conjunctions, and Scholarly Caution (B/C)** {#epic-skies-eclipses-conjunctions-and-scholarly-caution-bc}

Not all oral/literary claims can be directly verified by digging in
earth or diving undersea. Some relate to celestial events and require a
different approach. The Indian epics, especially the **Mahābhārata**,
contain remarkably detailed descriptions of the sky at certain key
moments. For example, the Mahabharata's war chapters mention that "two
eclipses occurred within 13 days", that certain planets were aligned
ominously (Saturn near Aldebaran, etc.), and that comet-like apparitions
and meteor showers took place before the great war. These clues have
tantalized researchers with the possibility that the text encodes an
actual date of the war. Using planetarium software and astronomy,
scholars like **Narahari Achar (2009)** and others (S. Raghavan, B.N.
Acharya, etc.) have tried to calculate dates that fit the epic's sky
descriptions. Achar, for instance, argued that the **Mahābhārata war
could have occurred in 3067 BCE**, claiming that on that year there was
indeed a lunar eclipse followed by a solar eclipse 13 days apart around
the autumn equinox, and that other planetary positions (Saturn in
Aldebaran, Jupiter in a certain nakṣatra) matched verses of the
epic[\[44\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicak%E1%B9%A3u#:~:text=Period%20of%20occupation%20ended%20with,Nicak%E1%B9%A3u%2C%20was%20a%20contemporary%20to)[\[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicak%E1%B9%A3u#:~:text=the%20King%20of%20Vatsa%20,8).
Another researcher, B. N. Narahari, came up with a similar date (around
3067--3050 BCE), while others have proposed dates like 1500 BCE or
5561 BCE based on different assumptions of text reliability and calendar
interpretation.

What are we to make of these attempts? On one hand, it's fascinating
that the epic *might* be encoding a real ancient date via its poetic
omens. On the other, the epic text is not a straightforward astronomical
record---these descriptions were subject to interpolations and poetic
license. For example, saying "a great evil comet appeared" is not
precise science; different readers could interpret different celestial
phenomena to fit that. Moreover, the **calendrical framework** of the
epic (whether it assumed a certain solstice position, or whether zero
corrections were applied) is debated. Thus, such efforts, while
methodologically interesting, remain **suggestive but not conclusive**.

**Confidence: B/C.** We give a **B** to the sincerity and scholarly
rigor of people like Prof. Achar -- meaning multiple analyses converge
around a *possible* date (many point to around 3000 BCE as a viable
candidate for a large war given the astronomical and archaeological
clues like
PGW)[\[44\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicak%E1%B9%A3u#:~:text=Period%20of%20occupation%20ended%20with,Nicak%E1%B9%A3u%2C%20was%20a%20contemporary%20to)[\[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicak%E1%B9%A3u#:~:text=the%20King%20of%20Vatsa%20,8).
But we assign **C** to the overall claim that "the Mahabharata war
happened on X date" because it's ultimately an inference resting on
assuming the epic's astronomy was meant literally and has come down
unaltered. The margin of error is huge (the text could have been
describing a general portentous sky, not an actual alignment; scribes
could have tweaked verses to sound more dramatic, etc.). In testing oral
correlates, this is a different kind of exercise than digging up a flood
stratum. It merges literary analysis with computational astronomy -- an
exciting interdisciplinary approach that Indian researchers have
increasingly explored. The result: a war on **22 November 3067 BCE**
(for example) cannot be stated as historical fact on par with, say, the
eruption of Thera or the battle of Kadesh which have strong dating
evidence. It resides in the realm of **plausible tradition**, given a
B/C credence.

We include it here to illustrate that some aspects of oral tradition
(like the memory of an auspicious or inauspicious sky) are extremely
difficult to either prove or falsify. The best we can do is line up the
claimed scenario with astronomy and see if it fits a real epoch. In the
Mahabharata's case, intriguingly, it does fit one epoch fairly well
(around 3000 BCE) -- a finding that harmonizes with some archaeological
estimations for late Harappan upheavals. However, until or unless more
corroboration is found (say, an inscription or artifact mentioning the
war), we treat epic-chronology attempts as **correlational experiments**
rather than established history.

> **"यथार्थं हि इतिहासः"** -- *Itihāsa* is "thus indeed it happened."  
> *(This is a cultural assertion of the intent behind itihāsa -- that it
> records reality -- but it is not an automatic guarantee of literal
> chronology.)* (Raychaudhuri 1--10)

In other words, ancient Indians *believed* their narratives were history
("it happened like this"), and they strove to keep details consistent
with that ethos. Modern analysis often finds truth in those details
(like floods and astronomical observations), yet we must apply
scientific rigor case by case to separate metaphor from fact.

## V. Janajātiya Philosophy: The Living Cosmos and Ancestor Law {#v.-janajātiya-philosophy-the-living-cosmos-and-ancestor-law}

### 1. **High God, Many Spirits: The Indian Animistic Baseline (B)** {#high-god-many-spirits-the-indian-animistic-baseline-b}

Despite the rich pantheons and sophisticated philosophies of Sanskritic
Hinduism, at its folk base Indian religion is profoundly **animistic**
and **ancestor-oriented**. Anthropological studies of tribal communities
across India---from Verrier Elwin's work among the Gond and Muria in
central
India[\[37\]](https://jagannathjinkd.weebly.com/about.html#:~:text=About%20,main%20temple%20at%20P%C5%ABri)[\[39\]](http://www.worldofmanojdas.in/legends-of-sri-jagannath.php#:~:text=What%20is%20amazing%2C%20there%20had,behalf%20of%20her%20father%2C)
to Stephen Fuchs' documentation of Bhil and Baiga beliefs---reveal a
common theme: the existence of a remote **High God** coupled with a
vibrant world of local spirits, ancestors, and nature powers. Typically,
tribes acknowledge a singular great deity, often called by names like
**Bara Deo** or simply **Bhagwān** (Lord) or **Dharmesh** (the Righteous
One), who is the creator or sky god. However, this High God is usually
deemed too distant or too abstract to concern daily life; he is not
propitiated regularly (sometimes only one annual ritual or none at all
is dedicated to him). Instead, religious life centers on numerous
**animistic spirits**: the spirit of the hill, the river, the grove, the
ancestors of the clan, the tiger of the jungle, the crop fertility
spirits, and so
on[\[39\]](http://www.worldofmanojdas.in/legends-of-sri-jagannath.php#:~:text=What%20is%20amazing%2C%20there%20had,behalf%20of%20her%20father%2C)[\[38\]](https://www.facebook.com/groups/541749669336231/posts/611475782363619/#:~:text=The%20Eternal%20Mystery%20Of%20Lord,mentioned%20earlier%20and%20hence).
Each of these is believed to be conscious and capable of intervention in
human affairs. For example, the Muria Gonds of Bastar (as Elwin
described) would dance and sing to please **Lingopenu** (a local earth
deity) and their ancestral skulls kept in the *ghotul* (youth dormitory)
rather than pray to an all-India god. The Saora (Savaras) of Odisha were
observed to be worshipping a jumble of deities -- the Sun and Moon, yes,
but also the spirit residing in a *sāl* tree, the ghost of a child who
died prematurely, etc. -- reflecting a worldview where *every element of
nature and every departed soul is part of a continuum with the
living*[\[32\]](https://jagannathjinkd.weebly.com/about.html#:~:text=The%20icon%20of%20Jagannath%20is,subject%20to%20intense%20academic%20debate)[\[33\]](https://jagannathjinkd.weebly.com/about.html#:~:text=Some%20scholars%20have%20suggested%20that,this%20day%2C%20a%20class%20of).

In this animistic baseline, moral order is maintained through **taboos
and appeasements** rather than philosophical inquiry. If someone falls
ill or a drought occurs, the question asked is: *"Which spirit or
ancestor have we offended?"* The remedy: a ritual offering, perhaps a
chicken's blood or an offering of rice beer on a rock under a sacred fig
tree. Many tribes have a concept of **ancestral law** -- the code of
conduct handed down by the ancestors, breaches of which cause
misfortune. For instance, the Khonds had the law that you must not cut
certain sacred groves; the Gonds have taboos on eating certain totem
animals of their clan; the Nagas traditionally believed the success of
crops depends on observing rituals for the spirits of the land.

What is fascinating is how this resonates with early Vedic religion. The
Vedic concept of **Ṛta** (cosmic order) and the importance of **Pitṛ**
(ancestor) rituals show that even the Vedic Aryans saw the cosmos as a
living moral entity sustained by correct relations with spirits (devas
and pitris). In the Vedas, if Ṛta is disturbed (by sin or by demons),
the world falls into chaos -- this is not far from a tribal villager's
belief that if taboos are broken, the village's harmony is lost. The
**Śrāddha** (ancestor offering) in Sanskrit tradition is a refined
version of what many tribal folks do at grave sites or memorial pillars
for their forefathers: feed them and seek their blessings. Stephen
Fuchs' detailed account of the **Gond and Bhumia of Mandla** noted that
they perform clan ancestor propitiation very similar in spirit to Hindu
*śrāddha* (though without Sanskrit
mantras)[\[39\]](http://www.worldofmanojdas.in/legends-of-sri-jagannath.php#:~:text=What%20is%20amazing%2C%20there%20had,behalf%20of%20her%20father%2C).
He also observed that the Gond idea of sin was tied to violating
ancestral custom (e.g., incest taboo, disrespecting a totem, etc.),
paralleling how early Dharmaśāstras linked sin to breaches of social
duty (which in ancient communities were likely derived from old tribal
codes).

Thus, far from being at odds, the tribal animistic worldview and the
Sanskritic worldview can be seen as **continuous layers**. One might say
the tribes kept alive the "Proto-Hindu" worldview of a **living cosmos**
where every rock can be divine and every ancestor is in the metaphysical
loop. Meanwhile, Sanskritic Hinduism systematized some of these into
organized theology (e.g., the doctrine that the One Brahman manifests as
many gods, echoing the notion that the High God manifests in many nature
forms). Indeed, the famous Vedic line we quoted, "एकं सद् विप्रा बहुधा
वदन्ति" ("Truth is one, the wise speak of it in many ways"), can be read
as an epitome of Indian pluralism that likely emerged from millennia of
integrating diverse tribal
truths[\[2\]](https://www.indiafacts.org.in/excavations-show-the-cultural-continuity-of-the-vedic-harappans/#:~:text=Moreover%2C%20the%20area%20known%20to,trace%20of%20Aryans%20penetrating%20India).

**Confidence: B.** This synthesis is supported by extensive ethnography
by different scholars in different regions and times, yielding a broadly
consistent picture of Indian
animism[\[37\]](https://jagannathjinkd.weebly.com/about.html#:~:text=About%20,main%20temple%20at%20P%C5%ABri)[\[39\]](http://www.worldofmanojdas.in/legends-of-sri-jagannath.php#:~:text=What%20is%20amazing%2C%20there%20had,behalf%20of%20her%20father%2C).
It's not a single provable fact but a cumulative observation -- hence
not A but a strong B. We see the **concordance** between Vedic and
tribal traditions not as coincidence but as inheritance: just as Heaven
(*Dyauṣ*) and Earth (*Pṛthivī*) are revered as Father and Mother in the
Ṛg-Veda, many tribes address **Sky-Father and Earth-Mother** in their
prayers, using their own
languages[\[1\]](https://jagannathjinkd.weebly.com/about.html#:~:text=languages%2C%20and%20so%20remains%20to,19).
The continuity of this divine parentage concept across cultures hints at
a deep civilizational unity amidst diversity.

> **"द्यावा--पृथिवी"** --- *Heaven-Father, Earth-Mother* --- a Vedic
> divine dyad mirrored by Adivasi invocations to Sky Father and Earth
> Mother. (Jamison and Brereton 1.160; Elwin 10--12)

*(This pull-quote highlights that even the most nature-rooted beliefs,
like calling the sky and earth one's parents, are shared between the
Ṛgvedic hymns and modern tribal prayers, emphasizing an ancient common
reverence.)*

### 2. **Law's Thesis, Updated: Tribes in India's Political History (B)** {#laws-thesis-updated-tribes-in-indias-political-history-b}

In 1943, the historian B. C. Law published *Tribes in Ancient India*,
making the then-novel argument that **ancient Indian history is
incomplete without its tribal ("aboriginal") component**. He
painstakingly collected references to various forest tribes, hill
chiefs, and hunter clans in Sanskrit literature and inscriptions,
demonstrating that they were not marginal but often central to political
and cultural
developments[\[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicak%E1%B9%A3u#:~:text=He%20succeeded%20his%20father%20King,2).
Law argued that many "legendary" accounts in the epics and
purāṇas---such as marriages between princes and tribal princesses, wars
with forest people, tribes founding cities or kingdoms---contain a
substratum of truth. For instance, the Nishada prince **Guha** who
ferries Rāma in the Rāmāyaṇa likely represents a real Nishada tribe
existing alongside early Kosala; the Bhil chieftain **Ekalavya** in
Mahābhārata reflects a non-Vedic archery tradition. Law also pointed out
that several historical dynasties had tribal origins: the **Nandas** of
Magadha were rumored to be of a low caste (perhaps tribal) lineage, the
**Chedis** had Bhil links, the early **Palas** drew support from forest
people in Bengal, etc. His overarching thesis was that the so-called
"Aryan" society continuously interacted with and absorbed tribal
societies -- through warfare, alliance, acculturation -- such that by
the time of the Mauryas and Guptas, the "mainstream" was already a
richly mixed current of
peoples[\[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicak%E1%B9%A3u#:~:text=He%20succeeded%20his%20father%20King,2).

Modern research has only reinforced Law's view. Excavations and
population genetics show that the subcontinent's populations have been
mixed for millennia; the archaeological record (as we saw with
Kalibangan, Hastinapur, etc.) shows cultural continuities that cut
across presumed ethnic divides. Historians like H. C. Raychaudhuri
acknowledged that, for example, the **Magadha empire** built by the
Mauryas likely incorporated many Munda or Dravidian-speaking tribes of
Bihar; the very success of that empire was due in part to inclusive
strategies (e.g., Chandragupta Maurya's general **Bhadrabahu** was
possibly of a forest tribe origin, some suggest). In the religious
sphere, we have clear cases like **Jagannātha** (discussed above) where
a regional cult of tribal origin became a state cult. In state
formation, we have the example of the **Ahom** kingdom in Assam, founded
by Tai-speaking invaders but soon assimilating local tribes (the Ahom
kings traced lineage from a sky god but freely intermarried with Naga
and Arunachali tribes, ultimately creating a syncretic polity). In law
and administration, the Manusmṛti itself lists various **jāti**
(communities) which scholars interpret as settled tribes integrated as
castes.

In contemporary terms, J. Sai Deepak and others have argued that the
Indian civilization's "inclusive federo-indigeneity" (to coin a phrase)
is a strength: India was not a melting pot that erased differences, but
a **salad bowl** where tribes retained identity (as we see in Northeast
or central India to this day) yet contributed fundamentally to the
national fabric. The political history of ancient India, as updated by
modern scholars, places tribal republics (like the **Yaudheyas**,
**Malavas**, **Licchavis**) on the map alongside
kingdoms[\[45\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicak%E1%B9%A3u#:~:text=).
The Buddhist and Jain texts too talk of **forest monastic retreats** and
**śramaṇa** sages learning from tribal hermits, indicating knowledge
transfer from tribals in matters of medicine, yoga, etc.

In conclusion, Law's thesis that *"Tribal history is Indian history"*
holds even truer with new evidence. What were once dismissed as wild
folk tales -- e.g., the Mahābhārata's narration of **Bhīma's marriage to
Hiḍimbā**, a forest rakshasa princess who becomes mother of Ghaṭotkacha
-- might be echoes of real alliances between Vedic clans and indigenous
forest clans. Archaeologically, weapons styles and fort styles sometimes
attributed to "invaders" could just as well be local tribal innovations
picked up by mainstream cultures. The infusion of **fresh blood from
tribes** kept the civilization dynamic. And crucially, many tribes
preserved older traditions that later became rejuvenating sources for
pan-Indian culture (e.g., the Bhakti movement drew on folk music and
dialects often preserved in villages).

**Confidence: B.** This is a broad synthetic claim, supported by a
multitude of specific cases (some of which we've cited) and scholarly
consensus moving in this
direction[\[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicak%E1%B9%A3u#:~:text=He%20succeeded%20his%20father%20King,2)[\[45\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicak%E1%B9%A3u#:~:text=).
It's not easily reducible to a single proof (hence not an A), but the
weight of evidence from diverse fields (history, archaeology,
anthropology) gives it a high credibility. As India's own constitution
recognizes, scheduled tribes are "an integral part of Indian life" -- a
truth that has deep roots. One might say the Vedic phrase *"वसुधैव
कुटुम्बकम्"* (the world is one family) found a practical expression in how
Indian civilization managed to incorporate *janajati* groups over time:
not by genocide or replacement, but by kinship and cultural exchange,
making them part of the family.

## VI. Methods, Ethics, and a Preservation Agenda {#vi.-methods-ethics-and-a-preservation-agenda}

Having traversed from prehistoric altars to modern temples, from geology
to folklore, a few methodological and ethical considerations emerge:

- **Use Paleography, Not "Vibes":** When engaging with ancient texts or
  oral sources, we rely on critical editions and scholarly translations.
  For Vedic hymns, for instance, we used the translation by Jamison and
  Brereton (2014) to avoid relying on memory or later conjectural
  translations. Precision in language is key: a single word
  mistranslated can spin wild theories. By sticking to academically
  vetted texts (for example, quoting the exact Sanskrit in
  Roman/Devanagari and giving sourced translation), we ground the
  discussion in verifiable data. This is particularly important when
  quoting oral tradition -- e.g., if we cite a Gond song or a Kond
  prayer, it should be from an ethnographer's transcript, not hearsay.

- **Archaeology First:** In this interdisciplinary field, our approach
  was to let archaeology and science lead, and then see what
  oral/literary traditions correlate. This guards against confirmation
  bias. For example, we did not start by assuming "Mahabharata war
  happened in 3000 BCE, let's find evidence." Instead, we looked at
  archaeologists' findings (PGW layers, flood strata) and then noted
  they match the epic's implications. Where oral claims *don't* match
  evidence, we must acknowledge that too (for instance, if an epic
  claimed a city existed at X but extensive digs find nothing, we record
  the discrepancy). The spade and the stratigraphy calibrate the story
  -- they are the touchstone to test each narrative claim. In places
  like Dvārakā, it was undersea exploration (Rao, Gaur et al.) that gave
  the green light to take the puranic tale more
  seriously[\[8\]](https://drs.nio.res.in/drs/bitstream/handle/2264/317/Curr_Sci_86_1256.pdf?sequence=1#:~:text=many%20folds%20during%20the%20medieval,last%20two%20decades%20in%20the)[\[22\]](https://drs.nio.res.in/drs/bitstream/handle/2264/317/Curr_Sci_86_1256.pdf?sequence=1#:~:text=opposite%20to%20the%20Gomati%20creek,with%20provision%20for%20dowels).
  Conversely, claims with no anchor (say, a legend of a flying city in
  the sky) remain D-level unless some evidence emerges (e.g., could be
  re-interpreted as a meteor if anything).

- **Confidence Badging and Transparency:** Throughout the paper, we
  appended **A/B/C/D** ratings to major statements. This practice, we
  suggest, should become standard when dealing with ancient history that
  mixes science and tradition. It forces clarity on what's firmly known
  vs. what is speculative. It also communicates to the reader the
  *degree of certainty or uncertainty*. For example, labeling the
  Sarasvati correlation as A gave readers confidence it's widely
  accepted by evidence, whereas labeling epic date conjectures as C
  warns them it's not settled. By doing this, we also lay open the
  methodology to scrutiny---readers may disagree with a grade, but at
  least the authors have made their evaluation process explicit.

- **Ethical Stewardship -- The Sai Deepak-style Juridical Clarity:** One
  takeaway from this integrated study is that India's heritage (tangible
  and intangible) is a shared inheritance of all communities, tribal or
  otherwise, and protecting it requires conscious policies. We propose a
  few measures:

- **Document and Return:** Launch and fund district-level oral history
  archives, where tribal elders and ritual specialists can record their
  epics, songs, and myths on video/audio (with proper translation).
  Crucially, ensure **community intellectual property (IP) rights** are
  retained; any publication or commercialization should share benefits
  with the community. After documentation, return copies of recordings
  to the villages (perhaps in local schools) so they too have a record.
  This prevents knowledge loss as younger generations drift away, and it
  empowers communities by valuing their narratives as history.

- **Ritual Custodianship Rights:** In cases like **Puri Jagannath** or
  other major shrines where indigenous lineages have traditional roles,
  state governance should formally **codify these rights** to prevent
  erosion or takeover. For instance, Odisha's temple administration laws
  could explicitly protect the Daitapati's hereditary prerogatives,
  while also binding them to certain accountability (so traditions
  continue but without exploitation). This legal recognition would
  follow the model of how some countries protect indigenous sacred
  practices by law. The goal is to preserve the unique fusion (tribal +
  classical) rather than let one side (often the Brahminical) steamroll
  the other under pressure of "reform" or commercial
  tourism[\[30\]](http://saralamahabharat.blogspot.com/2019/10/towards-understanding-jagannath-worship.html#:~:text=worship%20of%20Jagannath%2C%20are%20patimahapatras%2C,the%20question%20has%20often%20been)[\[31\]](http://saralamahabharat.blogspot.com/2019/10/towards-understanding-jagannath-worship.html#:~:text=,to%20be%20savaras%2C%20who%2C%20being).

- **Site Risk & Coastal Planning:** The cases of Dwarka and Poompuhar
  highlight that cultural heritage isn't only on land. A large part of
  India's history lies underwater or in ecologically sensitive zones.
  Therefore, coastal development (ports, bridges, dredging) should
  involve marine archaeologists in the planning stage. For example,
  before expanding a modern port near Dwarka, there should be surveys to
  ensure no damage to the submerged ruins; if tourism is promoted at
  Poompuhar's beach, an interpretation center about the sunken city
  could be included. Essentially, **heritage management must integrate
  new scientific findings** -- the sea isn't just economic zone, it's
  also an archaeological site.

- **Geo-Cultural Mapping:** We suggest a collaborative initiative
  between geologists and cultural scholars to create "Geo-heritage maps"
  that overlay physical changes with oral traditions. For instance,
  mapping the **palaeochannels** of now-extinct rivers (like Sarasvati)
  alongside local folklore of lost rivers can guide environmental impact
  assessments (EIA). If a new canal is to be dug in Haryana and the map
  shows it cutting through an ancient riverbed revered in lore, that
  should be part of the EIA -- both because it's archaeologically
  sensitive and because local communities might attach sentiment to it.
  In rural landscapes, many groves and ponds survive because of oral
  taboos (sacred groves are not cut). Recognizing these in official maps
  can help protect them as natural and cultural heritage zones, rather
  than treating them as empty land. The motto could be: *Oral memory
  informs scientific planning*.

In summary, by pairing A/B concrete anchors with C/D softer traditions,
we can prioritize where to dig or preserve (the A/B's warrant urgent
action to excavate, date, conserve), while treating the C/D areas as
guiding lights for documentation and future exploration rather than
immediate hard claims. **Figure 4** schematically illustrates this
"knowledge pipeline": how solid evidence (A/B) feeds into authoritative
history, while weaker evidence (C/D) is not discarded but kept in the
research program, often guiding us to the next discovery (as, say, the
Dwaraka legend guided the marine archaeologists in the first place).

Finally, a caution on **tone and inclusivity**: In reading India's past,
one must avoid two extremes -- a dismissive skepticism that treats oral
traditions as worthless (that approach would have missed out on finding
a Sarasvati or Dwarka), and a credulous naivety that accepts every
legend wholesale (which can lead to pseudoscience). The middle path is
critical empiricism with an open mind. The villages, the tribals, the
"little tradition" have kept echoes of the past alive; it is for
scientists and historians to respectfully listen, and then test. The
outcome, as we've seen, can be extraordinarily enriching -- a more
complete, colorful, **continuous** history of India that honors both the
śāstra and the *jana* (people).

**Glossary (Select Terms):**

- **Janajātiya (जनजातीय):** Pertaining to indigenous or tribal
  communities. (*Jana* = folk/people, *jatiya* = of a group).
- **Śrauta:** Related to the Vedic solemn rituals (*śrauta* rituals are
  those following the Vedas' prescriptions, like large fire sacrifices).
  Often involves multiple fire altars (*yajña-kuṇḍa*).
- **Yajña-kuṇḍa:** A fire-altar or pit used in sacrifice (yajña). In
  Vedic rituals, there are typically several kuṇḍas for different fires.
- **PGW (Painted Grey Ware):** A type of pottery (grey in color with
  black painted designs) dated to c.1200--600 BCE in North India. Its
  presence often marks the late Vedic/early epic period settlements
  (e.g. Hastinapura's PGW layer).
- **Daitā/Daitapati:** In Jagannath Temple, Puri -- the hereditary class
  of non-Brahmin servitors, claiming descent from the tribal Savara
  devotee of Jagannath. They perform key rites especially involving
  physical handling of the deity.
- **Palaeochannel:** The remnant of an inactive river course, detectable
  by geological surveys. (E.g., the Ghaggar-Hakra palaeochannel =
  ancient bed of the Vedic Sarasvati river).

**Section-wise Confidence Recap:**

- **Harappan fire-altars (Kalibangan)** and **Hastināpura flood**: A
  (established by excavation and stratigraphy).
- **Sarasvatī river palaeochannel** (Ghaggar--Hakra and Harappan sites
  alignment): A (multi-disciplinary scientific confirmation).
- **Dvārakā's submerged ruins**: A for the archaeology (city remains
  found); B for linking to Krishna's Dwarka (likely but interpretative).
- **Poompuhar's submergence**: A for physical evidence of inundation; B
  for linking to the specific literary flood event.
- **Jagannātha's tribal (Sāvāra) substrate and Daitapati role**: A for
  living institutional evidence; B for historical reconstruction of
  origin.
- **Gond oral epics paralleling Sanskrit itihāsa**: B for strong
  ethnographic documentation; C for the exact historical interplay with
  Sanskrit texts.
- **Mahābhārata astronomical dating attempts**: B for scholarly effort
  and some convergence; C for lack of decisive proof (still
  speculative).
