## Article Structure

This scholarly article examines the three major ṛṣi families who composed and transmitted the Ṛgveda, as catalogued in the Anukramaṇī tradition:

### Major Sections

- **Introduction:** The Anukramaṇī tradition as primary source for ṛṣi attribution
- **Part I: The Bhṛgu Lineage** (Maṇḍala II)
  - Fire cult specialization
  - Gṛtsamada Śaunaka (dual Āṅgiras birth, Bhṛgu adoption)
  - Cyavana's Soma rejuvenation hymn (RV 10.119)
- **Part II: The Āṅgiras Lineage** (Maṇḍalas IV, VI, VIII)
  - Gautama branch: Vāmadeva (Maṇḍala IV, 58 hymns)
  - Bharadvāja branch: Bharadvāja Bārhaspatya (Maṇḍala VI, 75 hymns)
  - Kaṇva branch: Partial Maṇḍala VIII
  - Indra worship and Soma rites dominance
- **Part III: The Kāśyapa Lineage** (Maṇḍala IX)
  - Soma Pavamāna specialists (RV 9.67, 9.113-114)
  - Kaśyapa Mārīca's 6 hymns
  - Purāṇic cosmogonic role (Prajāpati status)
- **Part IV: The Interwoven Tapestry**
  - Overlapping affiliations (Gṛtsamada, Cyavana)
  - Atharvaveda synthesis ("Atharvāṅgirasāḥ")
- **Conclusion:** Oral preservation mechanisms and lineage continuity

## Chronological Framework

### Scholarly Debate on Vedic Origins

This article focuses on **relative chronology** (which ṛṣi families came before others, generational succession within lineages) rather than absolute dates. The traditional "1500-500 BCE" compositional window for the Ṛgveda, inherited from 19th-century colonial scholarship, has been challenged by multiple lines of evidence:

**Evidence for 8,000-10,000+ Years BP Origins:**

1. **Archaeoastronomical Data**
   - Descriptions of Pleiades at vernal equinox (RV 10.85, Taittirīya Saṁhitā) → ~8,000 BP
   - References to Kṛttikā nakṣatra as year-marker → pre-3000 BCE precession calculations
   - Summer solstice at Maghā (RV 1.164.48) → 6,000-10,000 BP

2. **Geological & Hydrological Evidence**
   - Sarasvatī River descriptions matching active flow (RV 7.95) → pre-4000 BP when river dried
   - References to "seven rivers" system predating tectonic shifts

3. **Archaeological Continuity**
   - Fire altar traditions (yajña vedi) traceable to Mehrgarh (~7000 BCE)
   - Ritual continuity at sites like Bhirrana, Rakhigarhi

4. **Indigenous Traditional Frameworks**
   - Purāṇic Kalpa calculations placing Vedic era in much deeper antiquity
   - Oral transmission lineages (guru-śiṣya paramparā) spanning dozens of generations

### Our Approach: Preservation History, Not Composition Dating

This article adopts a **chronological agnosticism** regarding original composition, instead focusing on:

- **Relative Chronology:** Generation 1 (patriarchs) → Generation 2 (primary composers) → Generation 3 (disciples)
- **Lineage Succession:** Father-son and guru-disciple transmission chains
- **Maṇḍala Attribution:** Which family books belong to which lineages (undisputed from Anukramaṇī)
- **Preservation Milestones:** When oral traditions were systematized into written indices (~500 BCE Anukramaṇīs)

The dates cited for **preservation technologies** (Anukramaṇī codification, Sāyaṇa's bhāṣya) are well-documented historical events. The **compositional origins** of the hymns themselves remain an open question requiring interdisciplinary synthesis beyond the scope of this genealogical study.

### 3. RishiOverlapVisualization
**Purpose:** Venn diagram showing inter-lineage connections

**Key Overlaps:**
1. **Gṛtsamada Śaunaka:** Born Āṅgiras (Śunahotra), adopted by Bhṛgu (Śunaka)
2. **Cyavana:** Called both Bhārgava AND Āṅgirasa in different texts
3. **Atharvaveda:** Joint Atharvan (Bhṛgu) + Aṅgiras + Kāśyapa tradition

**Visual Design:**
- 3 overlapping circles (Venn diagram)
- Intersection zones contain shared figures
- Tooltips explain dual affiliations
- Click → scroll to article discussion

### 4. RishiGenealogiesBibliography
**Purpose:** Comprehensive searchable bibliography with 50+ sources

**Categories:**
1. **Primary Texts** (Ṛgveda, Atharvaveda, Bṛhaddevatā, Brāhmaṇas, Purāṇas)
2. **Anukramaṇī Editions** (Sarvānukramaṇī, Ṛṣyanukramaṇī)
3. **Modern Scholarship** (Macdonell & Keith, Jamison & Brereton)
4. **Online Resources** (Dharmawiki, Stack Exchange, Sacred-texts.com)

**Features:**
- Accordion sections by category
- Search/filter by author/title/year
- Sort: alphabetical, chronological, by type
