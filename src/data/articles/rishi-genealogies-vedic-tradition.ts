      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      
      <p>In Vedic culture, hymns of the Ṛgveda are attributed to inspired seer-poets (<em>ṛṣi</em>) who <em>heard</em> these verses in deep meditation and passed them down through their lineages. Over time, meticulous indices called <em>Anukramaṇīs</em> were compiled to preserve this attribution for each hymn: they list the authoring sage, the deity addressed, the meter, and other details. Foremost is the Śaunaka tradition's <em>Sarvānukramaṇī</em> (attributed to sage Śaunaka), which systematically catalogs the Ṛgvedic hymns' seers and deities. These ancient indices served a critical preservation function—not merely as genealogical records, but as sophisticated error-correction protocols for oral transmission.</p>

      <p><strong>For a detailed exploration of how the Anukramaṇīs functioned as "metrical checksums" and "multi-factor authentication" systems to preserve the <em>śarīra</em> (body/form) of the Vedas, see <a href="/sarira-and-atman-vedic-preservation">Śarīra and Ātman: The Preservation of the Vedas through the Anukramaṇīs and the Bhāṣya of Sāyaṇāchārya</a>.</strong> That article examines the Anukramaṇīs as preservation <em>technology</em>, while this present work explores the <em>human transmission chains</em>—the ṛṣi families themselves—that the indices catalogued.</p>

      <p>Complementing the Anukramaṇī is the ancient compendium <em>Bṛhaddevatā</em>, ascribed to the same sage Śaunaka, which summarizes the deities of the Ṛgveda and narrates legends behind the hymns' compositions. These source-texts – alongside the internal evidence of the hymns themselves – form the backbone of our understanding of ṛṣi genealogies.</p>

      <p>Three venerable ṛṣi families stand out for their prominence and antiquity in the Vedas: the <strong>Bhṛgus</strong>, <strong>Āṅgirasas</strong>, and <strong>Kāśyapas</strong>. These lineages recur in Vedic literature as authors of hymns and prototypical priests, and later tradition counts members of each among the legendary seven seers (<em>Saptarṣi</em>). In this article we explore each lineage in turn – identifying key hymns attributed to them, outlining intra-family connections (teacher–student relationships and successive generations), noting overlaps or shared attributions between clans, and highlighting each lineage's thematic legacy.</p>

      <h2>Part I: The Bhṛgu Lineage</h2>

      <h3>Hymns and Seers of the Bhṛgu Clan</h3>

      <p>The <strong>Bhṛgus</strong> are among the most ancient ṛṣi families, celebrated as pioneers of the fire cult. Numerous hymns in the Ṛgveda are attributed to Bhṛgu sages or their descendants (known by the patronymic <em>Bhārgava</em>). Most prominently, the entirety of <em>Maṇḍala II</em> (the second book of the Ṛgveda) is ascribed to a Bhṛgu: <strong>Gṛtsamada Śaunaka</strong>, who is explicitly identified in tradition as a <strong>Bhārgava</strong> (descendant of Bhṛgu). Gṛtsamada is the seer of <em>Ṛgveda</em> II.1–43, a collection of hymns mainly in praise of Agni and Indra. The Anukramaṇī calls him "Gṛtsamada, son of Śunaka" – Śunaka being of Bhṛgu's line.</p>

      [SEE COMPONENT: RishiLineageChart lineage="bhrigu"]

      <p>Beyond Maṇḍala II, Bhṛgu-related attributions surface elsewhere in the Ṛgveda. For example, Hymn 8.91 invokes the <em>"ancient ṛṣis"</em> who first kindled the sacrificial fires: <em>"As Aurva Bhṛgu did, as Apnavāna did, I call Agni the pure, bright-colored in the wood"</em>. Here <em>Aurva</em> and <em>Apnavāna</em> are legendary Bhṛgus remembered for igniting Agni in primordial times. Likewise, an Agni hymn in <em>Maṇḍala IV</em> (4.7.1) recalls how <em>"Apnavāna and the Bhṛgus made Agni shine forth, spreading from home to home"</em>. Such verses credit the Bhṛgu clan with the very discovery or awakening of fire.</p>

      <p>Another Bhṛgu sage appearing in the hymns is <strong>Cyavana Bhārgava</strong> – mentioned obliquely in connection with the Aśvins' healing miracles (e.g. ṚV I.116.10). Cyavana's presence (as an aged Bhṛgu rejuvenated by the divine twins) attests that multiple generations of Bhṛgus were active in Vedic memory, from the eponymous Bhṛgu down to his sons and grandsons who composed and lived the hymns.</p>

      <h3>Intra-Lineage Connections and Generational Overlap</h3>

      <p>The Bhṛgu lineage exhibits a strong sense of hereditary knowledge, with fathers, sons, and even more distant descendants all revered as ṛṣis. Traditional genealogies (found in Brāhmaṇa and Purāṇic literature) enumerate a line of descent: <strong>Bhṛgu</strong> (the patriarch) → <strong>Cyavana</strong> → <strong>Pramati</strong> → <strong>Ruru</strong> → <strong>Sunaka</strong> → <strong>Śaunaka</strong>, and so on. We see several of these figures reflected in Vedic texts.</p>

      <p>Within the Ṛgveda itself, explicit teacher–student or father–son pairings among Bhṛgus are not spelled out in narrative form (the hymns are not genealogical lists). Yet, the cumulative evidence of attributions and later commentary paints a coherent picture. Gṛtsamada's case is instructive: he is called <strong>"Gṛtsamada Śaunaka"</strong>, which implies his father (or ancestor) was Śunaka of the Bhṛgu line. In one traditional account, Gṛtsamada was actually born into an <em>Āṅgirasa</em> family (son of Śunahotra Āṅgirasa) but was later adopted by the childless Bhṛgu descendant Śunaka, thus entering the Bhṛgu lineage. This story, though recorded in later texts, is significant because it shows how Vedic clans sometimes intertwined – adoption or guru-disciple relationships could transfer a ṛṣi into another gotra.</p>

      <h3>Overlapping Attributions and Inter-Lineage References</h3>

      <p>The Bhṛgu lineage has intriguing intersections with other ṛṣi families. A prime example is <strong>Gṛtsamada</strong>, who stands at a crossroads of Bhṛgu and Āṅgirasa identity. According to one account, Gṛtsamada was the natural son of Śunahotra Āṅgirasa and only <em>became</em> a Bhṛgu by adoption. The <em>Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa</em> seems aware of dual affiliations: it notes that <strong>Cyavana</strong> (the son of Bhṛgu) <em>"is called either a Bhārgava or an Āṅgirasa"</em> in different contexts. This dual identification reflects that the <em>Bhṛgu and Āṅgirasa lineages were sometimes conceptually blended</em> or swapped in early mythic genealogy.</p>

      <p>The Atharvaveda and later tradition often speak of <strong>"Bhṛgu–Āṅgirasa"</strong> as a combined category, especially when referring to the primordial sages of the <em>Atharvaveda</em> (which claims descent from the sage Atharvan, often linked to Bhṛgu, and Angiras). The Atharvaveda's own name in some passages is <em>Atharvāṅgirasāḥ</em>, treating Atharvan (a Bhṛgu-related ṛṣi) and Angiras as joint founders of that Veda. This is another indication that the lines between Bhṛgus and Angirasas could blur; both clans were revered as ancient fire-priests who "found" Agni and Soma for mankind.</p>

      <h3>Thematic Legacy: Fire and the Bhṛgu "Fire Priests"</h3>

      <p>If one theme characterizes the Bhṛgu lineage in the Vedas, it is their intimate association with <strong>Agni</strong>, the sacred fire. The Bhṛgus are repeatedly depicted as <em>fire-priests par excellence</em>. The hymn cited earlier declares that Apnavāna and the Bhṛgus "caused Agni to shine bright-coloured in the wood" – essentially crediting them with the first friction fire or the first invocation of Agni in the sacrificial arena. Another passage describes Agni moving <em>"like Bhṛgu in each home"</em>, implying that the Bhṛgus carried the fire from home to home in the ancient sacrificial rites.</p>

      <p>Consequently, many Bhṛgu hymns are devoted to <strong>Agni</strong>. In Maṇḍala II, Gṛtsamada begins with Agni (RV 2.1 is an Agni hymn) and includes the famous and oft-recited <em>Ṛgvedic</em> hymn 2.3, <em>"Agni Devatā"</em>, invoking Agni as the messenger of the gods. The Bhṛgus are also linked to <strong>medicinal lore</strong> indirectly via the fire: the Aśvins' healing of Cyavana Bhārgava demonstrates the gods' favor on this lineage, restoring their elder to youth so he could continue sacred rites.</p>

      <h2>Part II: The Āṅgiras Lineage</h2>

      <h3>Hymns and Seers of the Āṅgirasas</h3>

      <p>The <strong>Āṅgirasas</strong> (descendants of the sage <strong>Angiras</strong>) form another core Vedic lineage, noted for their abundance of hymn composers and their close alliance with Indra and Soma. In the Ṛgveda's family-wise arrangement, several books are attributed to clans of Angirasīya affiliation. For instance, <em>Maṇḍala VI</em> is ascribed to the family of <strong>Bharadvāja Bārhaspatya</strong>, and the very epithet <em>Bārhaspatya</em> means "son of Bṛhaspati". Bṛhaspati (also called Brahmaṇaspati) in Vedic texts is both a deity and a legendary seer, himself identified as the son of Angiras in myth. Thus Bharadvāja and the hymns of Maṇḍala 6 firmly belong to the Angirasa lineage through Bṛhaspati.</p>

      [SEE COMPONENT: RishiLineageChart lineage="angirasa"]

      <p>Similarly, <em>Maṇḍala IV</em> is attributed to the <strong>Gautama</strong> family (the sage Vāmadeva Gautama being the primary composer). According to Vedic tradition, <em>"the Gautamas belong to the Angirasa tribe"</em> – in other words, Gautama is considered an offshoot of Angiras' line. This is confirmed in the <em>Vedic Index</em> and by later commentators who list Gautama among Angirasa-gotra sages.</p>

      [SEE COMPONENT: MandalaAttributionTable]

      <p>Apart from entire maṇḍalas, numerous individual hymns throughout the Ṛgveda carry Angirasa authorship. The <em>Kaṇva</em> family, for example, which contributed many hymns in <em>Maṇḍala VIII</em>, is often regarded as Angiras by affiliation. Early in the Ṛgveda, the <em>very first hymn</em> (ṚV 1.1) is to Agni by Madhucchandas Vaīśvāmitra; but Agni in that hymn is invoked as <em>"Angiras-like"</em> (Agni is even termed <em>Angirasa</em> in some verses, indicating the fire's connection to the Angiras priests).</p>

      <p>Moreover, Indra hymns attributed to Angiras descendants abound. For instance, <strong>Medhātithi Kāṇva</strong> (an Angiras) is the seer of Indra hymn 1.101; <strong>Hiraṇyastupa Āṅgirasa</strong> of Indra hymn 1.162, and so on. One notable hymn, <em>ṚV</em> I.100, is dedicated to Indra by Śatakratu Āṅgirasa, and in it Indra is lauded as <em>"the most Aṅgiras-like among Aṅgirases"</em>. This striking epithet reveals how closely Indra was identified with the Angirasa clan – to the extent of being called one of them.</p>

      <h3>Genealogy and Intra-Lineage Connections</h3>

      <p>According to sacred lore, <strong>Angiras</strong> was a mind-born son (<em>mānasa-putra</em>) of Brahmā, coeval with other great progenitors like Marīci (ancestor of Kaśyapa) and Atri. Angiras is said to have married <strong>Shraddhā</strong>, and their children included a host of fire-priests. One important line of descent goes: <em>Angiras → Bṛhaspati (also called Vācaspati)</em>. <strong>Bṛhaspati</strong> in later texts is regarded as the priest of the gods (often equated with the planet Jupiter) and as the <strong>guru</strong> of Indra. Bṛhaspati's own son is <strong>Bharadvāja Bārhaspatya</strong>, the seer of Maṇḍala VI as noted. Thus, we have a clear genealogical line linking Angiras to one of the major Ṛgvedic families three generations down.</p>

      <p>Another line from Angiras is through his son <strong>Utathya</strong> or <strong>Ulmuka</strong> (depending on the source) who had a son named <strong>Samvaraṇa</strong> and grandson <strong>Gautama</strong>. This connects to the Gautama lineage: indeed, Vedic tradition remembers that "the Gautamas belong to the Angirasa tribe". The sage Vāmadeva (ṚV Maṇḍala 4's author) is Vāmadeva Gautama, fitting into this branch.</p>

      <p>The <strong>Kaṇvas</strong>, another prolific clan, trace back to an Angiras named Kaṇva or Medhātithi. One famous teacher-student pairing across these lines is recorded in the <strong>Muṇḍaka Upaniṣad</strong> (which is a text of the Atharvaveda): <em>"Śaunaka, descendant of Śunaka (a Bhārgava), approached</em> <em>Angiras</em> <em>and reverently asked, 'Lord, what is that by knowing which all is known?'…"</em> Here we have Śaunaka (of Bhṛgu's line) as the student and <strong>"Angiras"</strong> as the guru, highlighting that knowledge flowed freely between the Bhṛgus and Angirasas in the highest esoteric teachings.</p>

      <h3>Overlapping Attributions and Inter-Lineage References</h3>

      [SEE COMPONENT: RishiOverlapVisualization]

      <p>As noted under the Bhṛgu section, the Angirasas frequently overlap with the Bhṛgus in early myths. The phrase <em>"Bhṛgus and Angirasas"</em> almost becomes a compound identity for the archetypal ancestral priests. In some Vedic verses and Brahmanical commentary, it's stated that <em>"the Bhṛgus and Angirases, our ancestors, first obtained the hidden Agni and the cows"</em>. One Ṛgvedic verse (RV 10.14.6) invokes <em>"the blissful Fathers, Yama, and Angirases"</em> to accept the offerings, implying all pitṛs (ancestors) might as well be categorized as Angirasas in the ritual context.</p>

      <p>The <em>Sarama-Pani</em> myth, one of the most famous in the Ṛgveda, provides a vivid stage for Angirasa interplay with other beings. <em>Saramā</em>, Indra's divine hound, converses with the Paṇis (demonic hoarders) in <em>ṚV</em> 10.108, demanding the release of the cows they stole. Although this hymn doesn't name the Angirasas explicitly, the backstory (as elaborated in later texts) is that <strong>Indra, aided by the Angirasa sages and guided by Saramā, tracks down the cows in the Paṇis' cave</strong>. After Indra smashes the cave and defeats the demons, <em>he lets the cows out and bestows them upon the Angirasas</em>.</p>

      <h3>Thematic Focus: Indra's Allies and the Soma Ritual</h3>

      <p>The Āṅgirasas' thematic signature is their unshakeable bond with <strong>Indra</strong>, the Vedic war-god and defeater of demons. Where the Bhṛgus were Agni's custodians, the Angirasas are <strong>Indra's priestly cohort</strong>. Countless verses depict Indra performing heroic feats "with the Angirases" or "for the Angirases." For instance, <em>ṚV</em> 1.62.4 proclaims: <em>"O Indra, with the Angirases you brought forth the Dawn; with the Angirases you found the cows,"</em> intertwining Indra's action with the agency of the seers. In this cosmology, the cows symbolize light/knowledge (hidden by demons in darkness), and it is Indra and the Angirases together who restore them – a metaphor for revelation of truth or cosmic order.</p>

      <p>The Angirases are also deeply involved in the <strong>Soma</strong> rites. While the Kāśyapas (discussed next) specialized in Soma Pavamāna (the filtering hymns), the Angirasas chanted Soma hymns to Indra, fueling him for battle. Soma is not only a ritual intoxicant but also a symbol of divine inspiration and immortality. The <em>Bṛhaddevatā</em> recounts that Angirases, along with Indra, drank Soma and then went forth to defeat Vṛtra (the serpent hoarding waters) and recover cosmic bounties. This theme threads through many hymns attributed to Angirasas: the interplay of <em>sacrifice → empowerment of gods → victory → prosperity for the ṛṣis</em>.</p>

      <h2>Part III: The Kāśyapa Lineage</h2>

      <h3>Hymns and Seers of the Kāśyapa Clan</h3>

      <p>The <strong>Kāśyapas</strong> (descendants of the sage <strong>Kaśyapa</strong>) hold a unique position in Vedic lore. While the Bhṛgus and Angirasas compose large swathes of the Ṛgveda, Kaśyapa's direct hymn contributions are smaller but critically placed. The sage <strong>Kaśyapa Mārīca</strong> (Kaśyapa, son of Marīci) is the attributed seer for a handful of hymns in <em>Maṇḍala IX</em> of the Ṛgveda – the book devoted almost entirely to <strong>Soma Pavamāna</strong> (the "purifying Soma" chants sung during the soma pressing ritual).</p>

      [SEE COMPONENT: RishiLineageChart lineage="kashyapa"]

      <p>Specifically, Jamison & Brereton's translation notes that Kaśyapa is the seer of hymns 9.67, 9.91–92, 9.113–114, and possibly 9.97 (a total of about 5–6 hymns in Maṇḍala IX). These hymns are poetic meditations on the soma juice flowing through the woolen filter, mixing with milk, and invigorating the gods – especially Indra. The verses attributed to Kaśyapa have a contemplative, almost mystical tone, emphasizing Soma's <em>pavamāna</em> (self-purifying) nature and its role as <em>king of plants</em> and <em>bestower of immortality</em>.</p>

      <h3>Intra-Lineage and Generational Connections</h3>

      <p>Kaśyapa's genealogy is striking because in Purāṇic and epic tradition, he is cast as a <strong>Prajāpati</strong> – a progenitor-deity who fathers not just humans but gods, demons, and all living beings. According to Purāṇic narratives, <strong>Kaśyapa was the son of the sage Marīci</strong> (himself a son of Brahmā), making Kaśyapa a grandson of Brahmā in the mythical genealogy. The <em>Atharvaveda</em> contains a cosmogonic verse: <em>"From Time (Kāla) was Kaśyapa self-born, from Time [was born] Agni."</em> Here Kaśyapa is placed even before Agni in creation order, highlighting his primordial status.</p>

      <p>Kaśyapa's own progeny is where this lineage truly flourishes in later tradition: he is represented as the ultimate <em>Prajāpati</em>, progenitor of countless beings. The Purāṇas and epics recount that Kaśyapa <strong>married multiple daughters of Prajāpati Dakṣa</strong> – variously 13 or more of them – and through these wives he fathered practically all categories of living creatures. For example: with <strong>Aditi</strong>, Kaśyapa begot the <em>Āditya</em> gods (including Indra, Varuṇa, Mitra, etc.); with <strong>Diti</strong>, he begot the Daityas (demons); with <strong>Kadru</strong>, the race of serpents (Nāgas); with <strong>Vinatā</strong>, the Suparṇas (eagles/garuḍas); and so on. Because of this immense familial output, Kaśyapa is revered in the epic-Purāṇic context as <em>"pitāmaha"</em> (grand-patriarch) of gods, demons, and all living beings.</p>

      <h3>Overlapping References and Shared Roles</h3>

      <p>The Kaśyapa lineage, being of such primordial stature, naturally overlaps with other traditions in various ways. We've already observed how Kaśyapa is frequently mentioned alongside the other great seers: e.g., lists that include Kaśyapa with Atri, Bharadvāja, etc., effectively integrate him into the pan-Vedic fraternity. Notably, Kaśyapa is <em>the only one of those seven who is credited with Ṛgvedic hymns</em> – among the Saptarṣis, many like Atri, Bharadvāja, Gautama, Viśvāmitra have hymns, but Kaśyapa's are fewer yet present.</p>

      <p>One significant overlap is with the <strong>Atharvaveda</strong> tradition. The Atharvaveda's primary mythical seers are Atharvan (considered a Bhṛgu) and Angiras – often invoked together. Kaśyapa, though not explicitly named as an AV founder, became closely linked in later perception. For instance, in some Purāṇic accounts, it is said that <strong>Atharvan</strong>, <strong>Angiras</strong>, and <strong>Kaśyapa</strong> jointly propagated the Atharva Veda. This is because the Atharvaveda deals heavily with spells for healing and prosperity – domains that Kaśyapa as a Prajāpati (and as per Ayurvedic tradition, a reputed medical authority) would be associated with.</p>

      <p>Kaśyapa also overlaps with the <strong>solar dynasty</strong> in an intriguing way: In the Rāmāyaṇa and other texts, some say Vaivasvata Manu (the progenitor of the Solar royal line) is Kaśyapa's son in one lineage enumeration. While these are divergent accounts, they again emphasize Kaśyapa's <em>universal parenthood</em>. In the epics, when the gods and demons churn the ocean, it is Kaśyapa's wife Aditi who gives birth to the gods (the Ādityas) and another wife Diti who gives birth to the demons – making Kaśyapa effectively father to both rival factions.</p>

      <h3>Thematic Summary: Soma's Patron and Progenitor of Life</h3>

      <p>The identity of the Kaśyapa lineage in Vedic and post-Vedic thought is twofold: <strong>masters of Soma's blessings</strong> and <strong>progenitors of the living world</strong>.</p>

      <p>From the Ṛgvedic perspective, Kaśyapa's foremost association is with <strong>Soma</strong> – specifically Soma in its benign, life-giving aspect. Many of the hymns Kaśyapa composed or inspired (RV 9.91–9.92, 9.113–114) praise Soma's power to invigorate gods and men. These hymns often have a gentler, more reflective tone compared to the battle-hymns of the Angirasas. They speak of Soma purifying (pavamāna), flowing through the woolen filter, mixing with milk, and "finding the gods."</p>

      <p>The emphasis on Soma's <strong>healing and nourishing qualities</strong> could be why later tradition ascribed medical knowledge to Kaśyapa (e.g. <em>Kaśyapa's teachings on Ayurveda</em>). One of Kaśyapa's hymns (RV 9.113) even has an undercurrent of universality: it mentions all plants (vīrudhāṁ patiḥ – lord of plants) in connection with Soma, hinting at Soma as the essence of all herbs – a key concept for a healer.</p>

      <p>The second grand theme is <strong>fertility and progenitorship</strong>. Kaśyapa's later reputation as father of gods, asuras, and all creatures suggests an archetype of fertility and creative diversity. In the Vedic wedding benediction comparing the couple to Kaśyapa and Aditi, Kaśyapa represents the ideal male principle of fecundity and Aditi the female – together birthing the <em>Ādityas</em> (who are solar deities, symbolizing light and sustainment).</p>

      <h2>Conclusion: The Interwoven Tapestry</h2>

      <p>In the foregoing survey, we centered on the Bhṛgu, Āṅgiras, and Kāśyapa ṛṣi lineages as preserved in Vedic lore. By drawing on the Ṛgvedic <em>Anukramaṇī</em> attributions, the narratives of the <em>Bṛhaddevatā</em> (augmented by Sāyaṇa's insights), and the testimony of the hymns themselves, we have traced how each lineage contributed to the hymnody and how they relate to one another.</p>

      <p>The <strong>Bhṛgus</strong> emerge as the primordial <em>keepers of the flame</em> – discoverers of Agni who passed down the art of kindling the sacrificial fire. Their hymns and legends revolve around fire worship, austerity, and the maintenance of cosmic order through the household and sacrificial flame.</p>

      <p>The <strong>Āṅgirasas</strong>, in turn, are the <strong>thunderous warriors of ritual and song</strong>, marching alongside Indra to vanquish darkness and retrieve the hidden lights. Their immense corpus – spanning Maṇḍalas IV, VI, VIII and numerous isolated hymns – testifies to a lineage that dominated the Ṛgvedic composition and whose descendants branched into many illustrious gotra families.</p>

      <p>The <strong>Kāśyapas</strong> stand somewhat apart, smaller in Ṛgvedic quantity yet cosmically grand in scope. As Soma specialists and progenitors in myth, they embody <em>purity, healing, and universal kinship</em>.</p>

      <p>All three families interweave: Gṛtsamada (born Āṅgirasa, adopted by Bhṛgu); Cyavana (called both Bhārgava and Āṅgirasa); the Atharvaveda's synthesis of Bhṛgu-Aṅgiras-Kaśyapa traditions. These overlaps are not contradictions but <strong>evidence of a living tradition</strong> where spiritual lineage, adoption, and mutual reverence blurred clan boundaries.</p>

      <p>The intricate web of ṛṣi attributions recorded in the Anukramaṇīs represents more than mere authorship credits—it is a sophisticated system of knowledge preservation that ensured the Vedas' structural integrity across millennia. While this article has explored <strong>who</strong> the composers were (the Bhṛgu, Āṅgiras, and Kāśyapa families) and <strong>what</strong> their thematic contributions entailed (fire cult, Indra worship, Soma liturgy), the companion study <a href="/sarira-and-atman-vedic-preservation">Śarīra and Ātman</a> examines <strong>how</strong> this attribution system functioned as a technical safeguard. Together, these two articles demonstrate both the <em>human</em> dimension (the ṛṣi lineages) and the <em>technological</em> dimension (the Anukramaṇī indexing system) of Vedic preservation. Furthermore, <strong>Sāyaṇāchārya's 14th-century commentary</strong>—discussed in depth in <em>Śarīra and Ātman</em>—later preserved the <em>ātman</em> (meaning/soul) of these lineages' works during a period of civilizational crisis under the Vijayanagara Empire.</p>
