# From Legends of Land Reclamation to Living Traditions: Geomythology and Cultural Continuity in India

## Introduction: Myths as Geological Memory

Ancient Indian lore is replete with tales of dramatic landscape transformations – mountains lifted or flattened, rivers appearing or vanishing, seas receding or surging. Far from being mere fanciful stories, many of these legends encode collective memories of geological events and ecological changes. This essay explores how two prominent land-reclamation myths – the **axe-wielding sage Paraśurāma reclaiming Kerala from the sea** and **sage Kaśyapa draining the vast lake of Kaśmīr** – may preserve **geological reminiscences** within their narrative layers. We examine these myths in detail and correlate them with scientific evidence of landscape change, revealing a striking convergence between **Purāṇic tradition and natural history**. In doing so, we also illuminate the threads of **cultural continuity**: how these myths have influenced regional identities, religious practices, and even modern storytelling. Themes from **indigenous (Janajātiya) traditions**, the recently popular film *Kantara* (which dramatizes a local land deity's lore), and the **veneration of fossils** as divine symbols will be interwoven to demonstrate the enduring legacy of these geomyths in Indian civilization.

The approach is both **rigorous and imaginative** – drawing on primary Sanskrit texts (Purāṇas, epics like the *Mahābhārata*, regional Mahātmya lore), authoritative translations (e.g. by Bibek Debroy and G.V. Tagare), and peer-reviewed research – while also venturing informed "leaps of faith" in interpretation. By treating myths not as arbitrary fiction but as **encodings of real experiences**, we follow in the footsteps of scholars like Hemchandra Raychaudhuri, who mined epics and Purāṇas for historical clues, and modern scholars who read folklore through a scientific lens. The result is a **geomythological monograph**: a narrative where the earth's story and human story fuse, and where stones, fossils, and landforms become as much a part of India's cultural inheritance as her scriptures and songs.
