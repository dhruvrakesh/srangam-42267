    en: `The twelve Jyotirliṅgas represent self-manifested forms of Śiva across the Indian subcontinent, forming a sacred geography that has been central to Hindu pilgrimage traditions for millennia. These sites are deeply connected to the Dashanami Sampradāya, the ten monastic orders established by Ādi Śaṅkarācārya in the 8th century CE.

The Dashanami orders—Giri, Puri, Bharati, Vana, Aranya, Sagara, Tirtha, Ashrama, Sarasvati, and Parvata—maintain a living connection to these sacred sites through pilgrimage networks, monastic establishments (maṭhas), and ritual practices. The geography of the Jyotirliṅgas reflects ancient trade routes, river systems, and centers of learning that predate the systematic organization by Śaṅkara.

Archaeological and epigraphic evidence suggests continuous worship at many of these sites from the early Common Era, with some traditions placing their origins in the Vedic period. The correlation with the Kumbh Melā sites (Ujjain, Haridwar, Prayag, and Nashik-Trimbak) reveals an intricate relationship between sacred geography, astronomical cycles, and monastic organization.

The Nāth Yogis, emerging between the 9th-13th centuries CE, developed parallel pilgrimage circuits often overlapping with the Jyotirliṅga geography. Their emphasis on haṭha yoga and tantric practices created a complementary tradition to the Vedāntic philosophy of the Dashanami orders.

This interactive map explores the twelve Jyotirliṅgas, their Purāṇic origins, associated rivers, ascetic orders, and pilgrimage significance, revealing a complex sacred landscape that continues to shape Hindu religious practice today.`
