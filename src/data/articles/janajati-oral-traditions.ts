## Overture: Reading Oral India with Rock-Hard Evidence

Indian civilization speaks in two registers at once: a textual register (śruti/smṛti, śāstra, itihāsa-purāṇa) and an oral-ritual register carried by *janajātiya* communities---forest epics, clan songs, cults of groves and stones. Older scholarship tended to oppose a "Vedic-Sanskritic Aryan" layer to a "tribal-animist non-Aryan" layer, but this dichotomy is increasingly undermined by hard data from archaeology, geology, and epigraphy. When we read the oral alongside the material, unexpected continuities emerge: for example, Vedic-style fire altars in mature Harappan contexts, an orally remembered **Sarasvatī** river that geology has traced as a "fossil" river, epic memories of cities lost to the sea that marine archaeology has corroborated, and "tribal" deities elevated into the Sanskritic pantheon without erasing their indigenous priesthoods. Each such case study in this paper pairs oral/literary tradition with a scientific or archaeological anchor from the Indian subcontinent (Confidence levels **A--D** as explained below).

**Confidence rubric:** We attach a grade **A--D** to each load-bearing claim. **A** denotes a claim tied to primary material evidence---excavations, stratigraphy, dated inscriptions or peer-reviewed scientific data. **B** indicates multiple convergent secondary sources or strong interdisciplinary agreement. **C** marks an inference with partial support (one of several possible interpretations). **D** is reserved for propositions resting on living oral memory or later textual testimony alone, without direct material confirmation. We explicitly label major claims with these confidence grades.

Two framing principles guide this study. First is a **paired-evidence rule**: cultural claims are, wherever possible, directly paired with a material or primary anchor (inscriptions, stratified finds, scientific analyses). Unpaired claims (solely literary or oral) are still discussed, but explicitly flagged with lower confidence. Second, **"script ≠ language" and "civilization ≠ single canon"**: the so-called Vedic/Sanskritic stream and the *janajātiya* (indigenous tribal) streams have long been co-flowing and intermeshed. Absorption and reciprocity---not abrupt rupture---best explain India's long religious history.

> **"एकं सद् विप्रा बहुधा वदन्ति"** --- Ṛg-Veda 1.164.46.  
> "Truth is one; sages speak it variously."

Methodologically, we start with **A-class anchors**---for instance, the fire-altars of Kalibangan, the flood stratum at Hastināpura, the Ghaggar--Hakra (*Sarasvatī*) palaeochannel, and Dvārakā's submerged architecture. These are presented with material details and scientific dating. We then test how oral and textual memories map onto those anchors.

## I. Archaeology That Talks: Fire-Altars, Flood Layers, and the Fossil River

### 1. Kalibangan: Vedic-Looking Fire on Harappan Brick (A)

One of the most striking material finds linking an ancient civilization with later Vedic ritual is the discovery of probable fire-altars at **Kalibangan** in Rajasthan. Excavations at Kalibangan uncovered a series of brick platforms oriented east--west, each bearing rectangular pit structures containing ash, charcoal, and burnt soil---essentially *yajña-kuṇḍa* (sacrificial fire pits) preserved in situ. B.B. Lal and colleagues, who excavated the site in the 1960s, documented at least **seven** aligned fire-pits on one platform, with accompanying features that strongly suggest ritual use: a nearby well for water (ablutions) and a dedicated sacrificial pit holding animal bones and antlers (evidence of animal offerings).

These installations are distinct from domestic hearths. The "altars" are built of mud-bricks and even had remnants of clay **pillars or posts**, possibly used to tether sacrificial animals (comparable to Vedic *yūpa* sacrificial posts) or to support a canopy. The layout---a row of aligned fire pits with a standardized orientation---closely parallels descriptions of Vedic *śrauta* sacrificial altars. B. B. Lal explicitly noted that these Harappan-era fire-pits **"could have served no other purpose than a ritualistic one"**.

**Confidence: A** (the claim rests on clear archaeological evidence: published excavation plans, stratigraphy, and artifact analysis support the identification of these features as fire-altars). **Implication (B)**: This find implies a cultural continuum rather than a sharp rupture between the **Harappan** civilization (3rd--2nd millennium BCE) and later **Vedic** ritual tradition. The ritual use of fire in a formal, altar-based setting may have *indigenous* roots in the Indus-Sarasvati (Harappan) civilization.

### 2. Hastināpura → Kauśāmbī: An Epic Flood Under the Trowel (A)

Another case where archaeology "speaks" to oral tradition is at **Hastināpura**, traditionally the capital of the Kuru clan in the Mahābhārata. In 1951--52 B. B. Lal excavated Hastināpura's ancient mounds and discovered a dramatic stratigraphic event: the settlement layer associated with **Painted Grey Ware (PGW)** pottery ended abruptly in a **thick clayey deposit**, indicating a severe flood dated roughly to the early **Iron Age (c. 9th century BCE)**.

Crucially, the **Mahābhārata** and Purāṇic sources contain a legend that **Hastinapura was swept away by the Ganga** during the reign of King Nicakṣu, after which the Kuru royals shifted their capital to **Kauśāmbī**. Lal's excavation appeared to validate the kernel of this story. At Kauśāmbī, archaeologist G. R. Sharma found that the earliest occupation level sits just above a flood-eroded layer, with PGW pottery in the lowest levels. This matches the traditional narrative: a devastating flood at Hastinapura and a subsequent relocation of power to Kauśāmbī.

**Confidence: A** (stratigraphic evidence of a flood layer ending one cultural period and correlating with dates from texts). **Scope note (C)**: Archaeology can demonstrate that a catastrophic flood **occurred** and that a settlement shift **occurred**, but it cannot directly confirm details of the narrative (names of kings, divine causation, etc.).

### 3. Sarasvatī: A River Remembered, a Palaeochannel Mapped (A)

Vedic texts lavish praise on a river named **Sarasvatī**, describing it as a mighty, life-sustaining river "flowing from the mountain to the sea" in the Ṛg-Veda's older layers. By later Vedic times, Sarasvatī is said to "disappear in the desert" at a place named **Vinaśana** ("the vanishing"). For a long time, this was thought to be myth---until satellite remote sensing, geophysical surveys, and geological fieldwork revealed the dry beds of a once-huge river in precisely the region indicated: the **Ghaggar--Hakra** channel in northwest India and Pakistan.

Starting with Yash Pal et al. in 1980, scientists have mapped via LANDSAT imagery a massive paleo-river course running through Haryana, Punjab, Rajasthan, and Sindh. This broad, now mostly dry channel aligns with the locus of many Harappan settlement ruins. Dozens of major Harappan sites (e.g. Kalibangan, Banawali, Rakhigarhi) lie along the banks of this extinct river system. Hydrological studies propose that the **Sutlej** and/or **Yamuna** rivers once contributed to the Ghaggar's flow before tectonic rechanneling diverted them.

**Confidence: A** (satellite data, ISRO reports, peer-reviewed geological studies confirm an ancient major river system in the Ghaggar-Hakra region that dried up by late Harappan times). **Correlation (B)**: The mapped palaeochannel correlates geographically and temporally with Vedic references to a great Sarasvatī that later "disappeared."

## II. Oral Memory as Archive: Dvārakā, the Andamans, and Living Ritual

### 4. Dvārakā: When the Sea Swallowed a City (A/B)

The Mahābhārata and various Purāṇas recount that after the great war, Lord Kṛṣṇa's capital, **Dvārakā**, was eventually swallowed by the sea. Marine archaeology conducted by the National Institute of Oceanography (Goa) off the coast of present-day Dwarka (Gujarat) has discovered submerged stone structures, including walls, bastion-like formations, and anchors, at depths of 10--40 meters. Radiocarbon dating of marine samples and pottery suggests some structures could be as old as **1500--1200 BCE** or possibly older.

**Confidence: A** (material evidence of submerged archaeological structures exists). **Correlation (B)**: The submergence aligns with Purāṇic accounts of Dvārakā being inundated. However, definitively proving these are the *same* Dvārakā of Kṛṣṇa's legend requires more work. The archaeology confirms that *a* significant ancient settlement was submerged, which oral tradition accurately preserved.

### 5. The Andamanese: Memory of Tsunami and Migration (B/C)

The indigenous peoples of the Andaman Islands---the Jarawa, Onge, Great Andamanese, and Sentinelese---preserve oral traditions about massive waves that reshaped their islands. Following the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, anthropologists noted that some Andamanese communities had moved to higher ground before the wave struck, guided by generational knowledge of "the angry sea."

**Confidence: B/C** (documented oral traditions and observed tsunami-preparedness behavior, but no direct material evidence of specific ancient tsunamis in oral memory). This demonstrates how oral traditions can encode survival-critical environmental knowledge across millennia.

## III. Janajātiya Absorption: From Grove Spirit to Temple Deity

### 6. Jagannātha of Puri: A Tribal God in Brahminical Dress (A/B)

One of the clearest examples of a *janajātiya* deity being absorbed into the Sanskritic mainstream is **Lord Jagannātha** of Puri, Odisha. Scholarly consensus holds that Jagannātha originated as a **Sāvāra (Sora) tribal deity** named Nilamadhava or Neelakanth, worshipped in a sacred grove. The wooden form, the unfinished limbs, and the non-anthropomorphic features of the Jagannātha mūrtis all point to tribal sculptural traditions rather than classical Hindu iconography.

Crucially, even today the **Daitāpatis** (hereditary servitors who claim Sāvāra descent) retain exclusive ritual rights at critical moments in the Jagannātha temple cycle, including the sacred *Navakalevara* ceremony where the wooden images are periodically replaced. This living arrangement---a major Vaiṣṇava temple staffed partly by a tribal priestly lineage---testifies to the absorption rather than erasure of indigenous tradition.

**Confidence: A/B** (historical records, temple inscriptions, and anthropological studies confirm the tribal origins and continued Daitā ritual roles). This is a textbook case of *janajātiya* deity becoming a pan-Indian god while preserving indigenous priestly lineages.

### 7. Śabarī and Hanumān: Forest Deities in the Epic (C/D)

The Rāmāyaṇa features **Śabarī**, a tribal woman (*śabara* = forest-dweller, hunter caste) who offers Rāma berries with pure devotion. **Hanumān**, though depicted as a monkey-god, has clear associations with forest tribes and *vānara* (forest-people) clans that likely referred to tribal groups. The epic's integration of these characters suggests that tribal communities were part of the Rāmāyaṇa's social world and that their veneration was already established.

**Confidence: C/D** (literary evidence and anthropological parallels, but no direct archaeological proof of specific tribal cults of Hanumān or Śabarī in Rāmāyaṇa times). The epic's sympathetic portrayal of tribal characters may reflect actual alliances or cultural exchanges between Sanskritic kingdoms and forest peoples.

## IV. Sacred Groves, Stone Worship, and Living Continuities

### 8. Sacred Groves: From Aranyakult to Āraṇyaka (B/C)

India's **sacred groves** (*sarnas*, *devrai*, *orans*, etc.) are pockets of forest preserved for religious reasons, often linked to local deities or ancestor spirits. These groves are maintained by tribal and rural communities across the subcontinent---from the Western Ghats to Northeast India. The Vedic tradition also venerates forests: the **Āraṇyakas** (forest treatises) and hymns like the **Araṇyānī Sūkta** (Ṛg-Veda 10.146, "Hymn to the Forest Goddess") reflect a parallel reverence for wilderness as sacred space.

**Confidence: B/C** (widespread ethnographic documentation of sacred groves and their role in biodiversity conservation and tribal religion). The continuity between Vedic forest veneration and *janajātiya* grove cults suggests shared or overlapping traditions rather than separate origins.

### 9. Megalithic and Stone Worship (B)

India has thousands of **megalithic** sites (dolmens, menhirs, stone circles), especially in the Deccan, dating from the Iron Age onward. Many tribal groups today still practice **stone worship** (erecting memorial stones, worshipping natural rock formations as deities). The Vedic tradition also includes stone worship: the **Śālagrāma** stones (representing Viṣṇu), **liṅga** worship (Śiva), and the *Varāha Purāṇa*'s injunctions to worship certain sacred stones.

**Confidence: B** (archaeological evidence of megaliths, ethnographic evidence of continuing stone-worship practices). The overlap suggests that stone veneration was a pan-Indian phenomenon shared by Sanskritic and *janajātiya* traditions.

## V. Synthesis: Reciprocal Acculturation, Not Replacement

The evidence reviewed here---from Harappan fire-altars to living Daitā priests at Puri---supports a model of **reciprocal acculturation** rather than one-way imposition. The so-called "Aryan" traditions and *janajātiya* traditions were never hermetically sealed from each other. They borrowed, merged, and co-evolved. This synthesis occurred at multiple levels:

1. **Ritual practices**: Fire worship, stone veneration, and sacred groves appear in both Vedic and tribal contexts.
2. **Deities and cults**: Tribal gods like Jagannātha entered the Sanskritic pantheon; epic heroes like Hanumān may have tribal prototypes.
3. **Social structures**: Tribal chiefs became *kṣatriya* dynasties; Brahminical institutions absorbed local priesthoods.
4. **Oral and textual memory**: Epics preserved memories of floods, migrations, and lost cities that archaeology has corroborated.

## VI. Conclusion: One Civilization, Many Voices

Indian civilization is best understood not as a monolith imposed from outside, but as a **symphony** of indigenous voices---*janajātiya* and Sanskritic, oral and written, animistic and philosophical---harmonizing over millennia. The archaeological and geological evidence confirms what the epics and Purāṇas have always claimed: that India's religious traditions are deeply rooted in the land itself, shaped by real rivers, real floods, real forests, and real communities.

The *janajātiya* contribution is not peripheral but foundational. From the fire-altars of Kalibangan to the Daitā priests of Puri, from the Sarasvatī palaeochannel to the sacred groves of the Deccan, the thread is continuous. **"एकं सद् विप्रा बहुधा वदन्ति"**---Truth is one; the wise speak of it in many ways. This paper has shown that the many ways include not only textual exegesis but also oral memory, ritual practice, and the testimony of stones and rivers.
