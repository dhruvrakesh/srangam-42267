### **Abstract**

This paper re-centers the Indian Ocean as a critical archive and method for understanding Indic civilization. Synthesizing the theoretical frameworks of "Ocean as Method" and "Hydrocolonialism," it moves beyond terrestrial, nation-state paradigms to explore the littoral as a primary site of historical and cultural formation. Through an analysis of Bhasha literary traditions—including classical Tamil Sangam poetry, modern Malayalam and Bengali novels like *Chemmeen* and *Padma Nadir Majhi*, and Konkani stories—the paper demonstrates how coastal ecologies and maritime life are encoded in vernacular narratives. It then extends this oceanic archive to the diaspora, examining Bhojpuri *jahaji geet* (ship songs) as a counter-narrative of the indentured experience. This textual and oral archive is read alongside material evidence from archaeology and ethnography, connecting ancient ports like Muziris and Puhar with the lived realities of contemporary fishing communities. The paper argues that this oceanic consciousness, which facilitates a "periphery-to-periphery" dialogue grounded in Enrique Dussel's concept of "Transmodernity," is essential for a decolonial "Bharatiya Renaissance." It concludes by proposing a digital humanities initiative to make these interconnected oceanic histories accessible, fostering an intellectual self-reliance (*Svarāj* of ideas) rooted in the subcontinent's deep maritime past.

### **Part I: Conceptual Moorings: Theorizing the Indic Ocean**

#### **1.1 Ocean as Method, Hydrocolonialism as Critique: A New Epistemology for the Littoral**

To comprehend the intricate histories sedimented along the Indic littorals, a fundamental methodological reorientation is required—a shift away from terrestrial, nation-state-centric paradigms toward an epistemology that embraces the sea. This reorientation can be constructed through the synthesis of two powerful theoretical frameworks: the concept of 'Ocean as Method' and the critical lens of 'Hydrocolonialism'. Together, they provide a robust apparatus for first recognizing the ocean as a legitimate and vital space of historical connection and then critically analyzing the power dynamics that have shaped it.

The proposition of 'Ocean as Method' offers a new way of thinking about the humanities and social sciences, urging a move beyond the artificial distinctions that fragment the world's interconnected bodies of water into discrete units like the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Oceans.1 This perspective challenges the "territorially incarcerative ideas of area studies" by compelling a recognition of the ocean as a singular, dynamic entity.1 By "thinking with the maritime," scholarship can trace the persistent movement of people, goods, and ideas that has always exceeded the remit of states and empires, thereby revealing more connected and interstitial histories that defy national boundaries.1 This approach analyzes the histories of traversing across connected spaces of water and land as they are recorded in literary texts, folklore, music, and performance, foregrounding a cosmopolitanism generated through the constant flow of ideologies and material culture.1 As global warming and rising sea levels underscore the porosity of the boundaries between land and sea, this method becomes not just an academic exercise but an urgent necessity for understanding our collective future.1

However, viewing the ocean solely as a space of connection risks obscuring the violent histories of power and domination enacted upon its waters. It is here that Isabel Hofmeyr's concept of 'Hydrocolonialism' provides an essential critical corrective. Hydrocolonialism shifts the analytical focus from land-based epistemologies to the coast, the shore, and the sea, recasting them as primary spaces for "exercising and defending imperial power over the colony".3 The port, in this framework, is not merely a point of entry but a liminal zone of intense border policing, a site where the colonial state regulated the flow of people and ideas into and out of the imperial system.3 Hofmeyr develops this framework from her study of the Custom House archives, introducing the related concept of "dockside reading"—the practice of customs officials who had to "read" cargo to ascertain its origin, legitimacy, and classification for tariffs.3 This practice, which extended to scanning books for seditious or obscene content, serves as a powerful illustration of how the colonial state managed, controlled, and censored the intellectual and material currents flowing across the ocean.3

These two frameworks are profoundly complementary. 'Ocean as Method' supplies the broad epistemological paradigm, validating the sea as a central category of historical analysis and breaking free from the constraints of national histories. 'Hydrocolonialism' furnishes the critical methodology, providing the tools to dissect the operations of power, violence, and resistance within this oceanic paradigm. By integrating them, it becomes possible to first open up the Indic Ocean as a vast archive of interconnected histories and then to read that archive critically, understanding it as a contested space where imperial ambitions and subaltern survivals have been written and rewritten by the tides of history.

#### **1.2 Transmodernity and the Pluriversal Dialogue: Situating the Bharatiya Renaissance**

The call for a "Bharatiya Renaissance" through the exploration of oceanic archives is not an argument for nationalist revivalism or a retreat into an imagined past. Rather, it is an assertion of an alternative modernity, a decolonial project that finds its philosophical grounding in the work of the Latin American philosopher Enrique Dussel. By positioning this renaissance within Dussel's concepts of 'Transmodernity' and 'transversal critique', it can be understood as a contribution to a "pluriversal" world—a world of multiple, co-existing modernities engaged in a dialogue of civilizations rooted in non-European historical experiences.

Dussel's primary intervention is a radical critique of Eurocentric modernity. He posits that the European modern period is not characterized by pure reason but by the development of a masterful, conquering subjectivity—the "*I conquer ego*"—nurtured by the experience of colonizing the New World.4 This modernity, foundational to the philosophies of Descartes, Kant, and Hegel, defines itself by systematically silencing, peripheralizing, and subsuming the "Other" under its own universalizing logic.4 For Dussel, even postmodern critiques are insufficient, as they remain trapped within the "mythic history of modernity" and fail to address its colonial roots.4

In response, Dussel proposes 'Transmodernity' as a project that transcends this singular, Eurocentric modernity. Transmodernity is a meta-narrative with a truly global and universal reference, one that affirms the rich exteriority of cultures that were colonized and peripheralized.4 It is not anti-modern; it is a call for a world of multiple modernities, a "pluriverse" where different civilizational projects can engage with one another through what Dussel calls "transversal dialogue".4 This is a critical, intercultural dialogue that does not presuppose the formal symmetry of cultures or the universal validity of Western norms, but instead emerges from the praxis and lived experience of the oppressed.4

This philosophical framework provides a powerful lens through which to interpret the contemporary discourse on a "Bharatiya Renaissance." This discourse, emerging from efforts to decolonize Indian education and revive Indigenous Knowledge Systems (IKS), seeks to move beyond the epistemic violence of Macaulay's colonial legacy and the dominance of Western canons.6 The goal is to recover from a state of "civilizational amnesia" (

*Ātmavismṛta*) and achieve a "*Svarāj* of ideas"—an intellectual self-reliance.7 When such a cultural reassertion occurs in India, it is often dismissed by Western-oriented academia as "revivalism or obscurantism," whereas a similar process in Europe is lauded as a "Renaissance".7

Dussel's philosophy offers a way to transcend this biased framing. The "Bharatiya Renaissance" envisioned here is a transmodern project. It is an effort to re-engage with the world not from a position of victimhood or imitation, but from a renewed confidence in India's own intellectual traditions and historical experiences—experiences that are deeply oceanic and interconnected. It represents a "periphery-to-periphery" dialogue, where the decolonial projects of the Global South can inform and strengthen one another, bypassing the old colonial center.8 By embracing its littoral and diasporic histories, this renaissance contributes to the creation of a pluriversal world, asserting its own path to modernity while remaining in critical, creative dialogue with others.

### **Part II: The Littoral Archive: Reading the Coast in Bhasha Traditions**

The Bhasha literary traditions of India's coastal regions serve as profound and deeply textured archives of maritime life. They are the vessels that carry the memories, ecologies, social structures, and emotional worlds of the littoral. More than mere artistic representations, these texts encode the material realities of coastal existence, from the economic imperatives of sea trade to the unwritten laws governing human interaction with the volatile ocean. An analysis of these traditions reveals a sophisticated interplay between the inner world of human emotion (*akam*) and the outer world of ecological and economic reality (*puram*).

#### **2.1 Echoes of the Sangam Shore: Ecology and Emotion in Neithal Thinai**

The classical Tamil Sangam poetic tradition, particularly the corpus of poems categorized under the *Neithal thinai* (the littoral landscape), offers one of the world's oldest and most nuanced literary archives of a maritime ecology. While conventionally defined by the theme of *irankal* (longing in separation), a deeper reading reveals that this emotional landscape is not an abstract universal but is fundamentally rooted in the socio-economic realities of the ancient Tamil coast.9 The poetry meticulously documents how the very source of the community's sustenance—the sea—is also the source of its deepest anxieties.

The central mood of *Neithal* is the grief of separation, where the heroine (*talaivi*) expresses her profound longing for the absent hero (*talaivan*).9 The vast, ceaseless horizon, the rhythmic ebb and flow of the waves, and the cry of the seabirds become a "metaphorical canvas" for exploring despair and the agonizing elasticity of time distorted by waiting.9 In one poignant verse, the heroine's tears are described as "hot enough to singe my eyelashes," falling ceaselessly like the saltwater of the very sea that separates her from her beloved.9 This emotional turmoil, however, is not a product of arbitrary fate but of a specific economic structure. The separation is explicitly gendered and economically motivated: the male figure is absent because he has embarked on long and perilous sea voyages "for wealth or duty".9 The entire emotional architecture of the

*Neithal* genre, therefore, rests upon the material foundation of a maritime economy that necessitated male absence for the community's prosperity. The poetry archives the profound social and emotional cost of this livelihood.

Beyond its emotional depth, the *Neithal thinai* functions as a rich ethnographic and ecological repository. The poems present "charming vignettes of the seascape," meticulously detailing the coastal environment.9 They name the specific flora, such as the

*punnai* and *gnazhal* trees and water lilies, and the fauna, from crabs and seagulls to sharks and crocodiles.9 They paint vivid pictures of daily life: fisherwomen mending nets on the cool, sandy shores, their talk of love mingling with the smell of drying fish, while the menfolk set out on their "big hulled boats" for the catch.9 This detailed rendering of the littoral world provides invaluable data, transforming the poems from mere love lyrics into a comprehensive archive of the material culture, ecological knowledge, and social organization of the Sangam-era coastal communities.

#### **2.2 Myth, Modernity, and the Malayalam Coast: Reading the Law of the Sea in Chemmeen**

Thakazhi Sivasankara Pillai's seminal 1956 Malayalam novel, *Chemmeen*, stands as a powerful modern testament to the enduring relationship between a coastal community and the sea, dramatizing the tragic collision of ancient myth, social taboo, and the disruptive forces of individual desire and economic ambition. Set among the Arayan fishing community of Kerala, the novel's central conflict is governed by the myth of *Kadalamma*, the sea goddess. This myth operates not as mere folklore but as a form of vernacular jurisprudence—an unwritten, sacred law that regulates social behavior to ensure cosmic and material order in a precarious world.11

The foundational law of this community holds that the safety of a fisherman at sea is directly contingent upon the chastity of his wife on shore. If a married fisherwoman is unfaithful, the benevolent *Kadalamma* (Mother Sea), who is the provider of all sustenance, will transform into a wrathful goddess and consume her husband in the waves.13 This belief system forges an unbreakable link between female virtue and male survival, making a woman's fidelity a matter of communal life and death.14 The sea is thus mythologized as both a generous mother and a terrifying judge, the ultimate arbiter of the community's moral and physical well-being.12 This law is deeply internalized, policed by the community, and passed down through generations, as seen when the mother, Chakki, warns her daughter Karuthamma of the dire consequences of transgressing this sacred code.13

The tragedy of *Chemmeen* unfolds as this traditional legal-mythic system is challenged by modern pressures. The central narrative follows the forbidden love between Karuthamma, a Hindu of the Arayan community, and Pareekutty, a Muslim fish trader.14 Their relationship violates the rigid boundaries of both religion and caste, representing a profound threat to the established social order.16 Compounding this is the force of economic aspiration. Karuthamma's father, Chembankunju, is consumed by the ambition to own his own boat and net—a symbol of upward mobility. He achieves this goal only by accepting a loan from Pareekutty, an economic transaction that crosses religious lines and inextricably links his family's fate to Karuthamma's forbidden lover.14

The novel's climax can be read as a jurisprudential verdict. When Karuthamma finally succumbs to her love for Pareekutty, her husband, Palani, is caught in a whirlpool and devoured by the sea, a direct execution of the law of *Kadalamma*.14 The subsequent discovery of the lovers' bodies washed ashore confirms the restoration of the cosmic order at a devastating human cost.

*Chemmeen* thus archives the violent disintegration of a traditional social and legal framework under the combined weight of romantic individualism, inter-religious economic entanglement, and the enduring power of a myth that ties human destiny to the moral judgment of the sea.

#### **2.3 The Scripture of Silt: Fluvial Ecologies in Bengali Narrative**

In Manik Bandopadhyay's 1936 masterpiece, *Padma Nadir Majhi* (The Boatman of the Padma), the river is elevated from a mere setting to the novel's primary antagonist and most powerful agent. The narrative is governed by what can be termed the "scripture of silt"—the ever-changing, unstable text of the riverbank itself, which dictates the fragile existence of the fishing communities along its shores. The novel presents a powerful ecocritical vision where the Marxist critique of class exploitation is inseparable from the environmental precarity of a community whose lives are written and erased by the river's whims.19

The Padma is depicted not as a static landscape but as a dynamic, animate force. It is a "natural, free-flowing river" characterized by extreme and unpredictable patterns of erosion that can "swallow large chunks of the shore," constantly redrawing the map of human settlement.21 This physical instability is mirrored in the novel's portrayal of the river as a "mysterious entity" that vacillates between being a "divinity of kindness" and a "monster avatar that engulfs the lives and livelihoods of the residents".22 The very land the characters inhabit is ephemeral; new sandbars (

*chars*) emerge from the silt only to be submerged again by the river's currents, making any sense of permanence impossible.22 This constant flux, driven by floods, storms, and erosion, is the fundamental condition of life for the boatmen of Ketupur village.22

This profound ecological vulnerability is the bedrock upon which the novel's social and economic drama is built. The characters' lives are a relentless struggle for survival against the "pangs of hunger" and economic deprivation.20 This precarity is what makes them susceptible to the schemes of the enigmatic trader Hossain Mian, who offers them an escape to his supposedly utopian island colony, Moyna Dweep.22 Hossain Mian's power is derived directly from the river's hostility; it is the constant threat of displacement by flood and erosion that fuels the fishermen's desire for "ecological migration".22 In a Marxist analysis, the river Padma functions as the community's primary "means of production." However, unlike a factory or a field, this means of production is animate, volatile, and actively destructive. It is a force that provides sustenance one day and "grasps and devours the lives of the poor communities" the next.22 The class struggle depicted in the novel, therefore, is not a simple binary of labor versus capital. Instead, it is a complex triangulation of labor, capital, and a powerful, non-human ecological force. The environmental precarity created by the river's "scripture of silt" is the essential precondition for the social exploitation that follows, demonstrating an inextricable link between ecological instability and human vulnerability.

#### **2.4 The Konkani Littoral and its Moral Geographies**

The works of Jnanpith awardee Damodar Mauzo offer a profound exploration of the Goan littoral, not merely as a coastal landscape but as a complex moral geography. Shaped by centuries of oceanic trade and its history as a Portuguese colony, the Konkan coast in Mauzo's fiction becomes a liminal space—a threshold where diverse religions, cultures, and ethical systems converge, clash, and intermingle. His stories, written with a characteristic blend of empathy and sharp critique, use this unique social crucible to dissect the ambiguities of human nature, the hypocrisies of social convention, and the persistent struggle for ethical integrity.24

Goa's history as a major maritime hub has produced the "multireligious community" that forms the backdrop of Mauzo's narratives.26 This is a world where Hindu, Catholic, and Muslim lives are deeply intertwined, creating a social fabric rich with syncretic practices but also fraught with underlying tensions. Fishing, for instance, is described as central to Goan culture across all communities, a shared practice that binds the littoral society together.27 This historical layering makes the Goan coast a liminal zone where fixed identities and moral certainties are constantly being negotiated. Mauzo's characters are often caught in the fault lines between these overlapping worlds, facing dilemmas that arise from this unique, sea-shaped environment.

His stories delve into the ethical fallacies that thrive in such a contact zone. In one story, a cab driver cynically alters his religious identity—presenting as Hindu, Muslim, or Christian—to match his passengers, modifying local legends to satisfy their fanaticism and earn a better fare.26 This act encapsulates the performative and often opportunistic nature of identity in a syncretic society. Other stories tackle the deep-seated nature of patriarchy, as in 'The Coward', which explores a man's pride in his machismo and its destructive impact on his family, set against the backdrop of Goa's traditional

*tiatr* theatre.26 Mauzo also turns his critical gaze on moral hypocrisy, as in 'I Was Waiting for You', which exposes the gap between public values and private actions.26 Yet, his work is not without hope, often celebrating acts of empathy and the struggle to maintain one's humanity against overwhelming odds, as seen in 'As the Ice Melts'.26

The ethnographic reality of the Goan coast provides a material context for these literary explorations. Studies of the Kharvi fishing community, for example, reveal unique social structures, particularly the economic empowerment of Goan Catholic fisherwomen who have transitioned from "barefoot, headload peddlers" to successful market entrepreneurs.29 This economic shift has led to more egalitarian gender relations within their households, representing a "reversal of the dominant patriarchal norms of Indian society".29 Mauzo's fiction, while not always explicitly about fishing, is deeply informed by this complex social reality. The Goan littoral in his work is a space where traditional hierarchies are both reinforced and challenged, a moral landscape where the currents of history have left behind a rich, and often turbulent, human legacy.

### **Part III: The Diasporic Archive: Memory and Movement Across the Kala Pani**

The oceanic archive is not limited to the homelands of the littoral; it extends across the vast, traumatic passages of diaspora. The Indian Ocean, for centuries a space of voluntary trade and cultural exchange, was transformed during the colonial era into a conduit for forced and semi-forced migration. The system of indentured servitude, which followed the abolition of slavery, created a new kind of oceanic archive—one of displacement, suffering, and resilience. This history is preserved not in the official ledgers of empire, but in the oral traditions and cultural memories of the displaced, who carried their Bhasha worlds with them across the *kala pani* (black water).

#### **3.1 The Girmitiya's Passage: The Ship as Hydrocolonial Space**

The indenture ship of the 19th and early 20th centuries was a quintessential instrument of hydrocolonial power. Following the Slavery Abolition Act of 1833, the British Empire instituted the indenture system to address labor shortages in its plantation colonies, transporting over 1.6 million workers from British India to locations such as Mauritius, Trinidad, Fiji, and British Guiana.41 These vessels were floating extensions of the colonial state, designed to efficiently move human cargo—referred to as "coolies"—across the globe. The journey itself was a process of social and existential rupture, a crossing of the

*kala pani* that, according to orthodox Hindu belief, resulted in a loss of caste and a profound sense of alienation.41

The system was predicated on a foundation of coercion and deceit. A significant majority of the laborers were Bhojpuri speakers from the impoverished regions of Eastern Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.41 They were lured by recruiters with misleading promises of prosperity, bound by a contract they often could not read. The very term for an indentured laborer,

*Girmitiya*, is a vernacular corruption of the English word "agreement," a linguistic scar that testifies to the deceptive nature of the entire enterprise.41 The hope of returning home after the five-year contract period was often an illusion, and the system resulted in the permanent displacement of millions.41

The physical conditions on board these ships, while representing a marginal improvement over those on slave ships, were brutal. Passengers were allocated approximately 15 superficial feet of space in a large, shared room between decks.43 Though ventilation was a priority, this crowded and often unsanitary environment was a breeding ground for disease.43 Cholera, in particular, was rampant, and early voyages were marked by staggering mortality rates, sometimes exceeding 17%.42 The journey was a site of immense physical and psychological trauma, a "double displacement" for women, who were especially vulnerable to exploitation both before and during the voyage.41

Yet, this hydrocolonial space of control and suffering paradoxically became the crucible for a new, shared identity. Thrown together in the belly of the ship, individuals from different castes, villages, and backgrounds were stripped of their old social markers and forged into a new collective by their shared ordeal. The experience of the passage created the bonds of the *jahaji-bhai* (ship-brother), uniting them in a common struggle. The indenture ship, intended by the empire as a machine for producing compliant labor units, thus became the unintentional birthplace of the resilient, diasporic *Girmitiya* community.

#### **3.2 Jahaji Geet as Living Archive: Singing the Counter-Narrative**

In the face of a colonial archive that systematically erased the subjective experience of the indentured laborer, the *Girmitiyas* created their own archive—an oral, living repository carried in the melodies and lyrics of their folk songs. These Bhojpuri songs, known as *jahaji geet* (ship songs) or, in the Mauritian context, as *Geet Gawai*, constitute a powerful subaltern counter-narrative to the official history of indenture.41 They preserve the emotional truth of the

*girmit* experience: the pain of separation, the bitterness of betrayal, and the enduring, melancholic longing for a lost homeland.

This cultural heritage was portable, carried in the minds and voices of the laborers. On the arduous sea voyages, Bhojpuri-speaking workers performed these folk songs and dances to voice their concerns, share their sorrows, and organize resistance, transforming their cultural practices into essential tools for building solidarity.41 The songs became a vessel for collective memory, ensuring that the history of their displacement would not be forgotten. The tradition of

*Geet Gawai*, a combination of rituals, prayers, and songs performed primarily by women, was recognized by UNESCO as an Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity in 2016, a testament to its role in preserving the cultural and historical memory of the diaspora.41

The lyrics of these songs function as a direct indictment of the indenture system. They are a "painful reminder of the deceptive 'girmit'".41 One protest song starkly warns potential recruits: "It is not service. It is woe. \[...\] Instead of rupees, rubbish will fall (on you). They are taking you across the sea\! To Mauritius, to Demerara... They are not islands; they are hell".41 This raw testimony stands in stark contrast to the sanitized language of colonial reports and contracts. Other songs, particularly in the

*purbi* and *birha* genres, focus on the deep emotional trauma of separation (*biraha*).41 They articulate the seemingly "endless wait for their return," giving voice to the women and families left behind.44

These songs also preserved an idealized memory of the homeland, which became a source of solace and cultural identity in a hostile new world. The famous *purbi* "Batohiya" (O Traveller), composed by Babu Raghuvir Narayan, became immensely popular among the diaspora. Its lyrics paint a picture of India as a "beautiful good land" (*Sundar subhumi bhaiya Bharat ke deshwa se*), a heaven of snowy mountains, roaring seas, and singing cuckoos, for which the migrant's soul yearns.45 This act of remembering through song was a decolonial act of archival preservation. While the official colonial archive recorded the

*Girmitiya* as a number on a ledger, the oral archive of the *jahaji geet* preserved their humanity, their history, and their unbreakable connection to a land they would likely never see again. Over time, these traditions evolved, blending with local musical forms to create vibrant new genres like Chutney music in the Caribbean, demonstrating the dynamic and adaptive power of this living, oceanic archive.44

### **Part IV: Material Archives: Reconstructing Littoral Histories from Ports and Peoples**

The rich narratives found within Bhasha literatures and oral traditions are not isolated cultural artifacts; they are deeply enmeshed with the material world. To fully appreciate the ocean as an archive, these textual and oral sources must be read alongside the physical evidence unearthed by archaeologists and the lived realities documented by ethnographers. This synthesis of material, literary, and living archives allows for a multi-dimensional reconstruction of Indic maritime histories, demonstrating both their deep antiquity and their urgent contemporary relevance.

#### **4.1 Unearthing the Emporia: Archaeology of the Ancient Indic Ports**

Archaeological explorations at the great port cities of ancient India provide tangible, material corroboration for the vibrant maritime worlds depicted in Sangam literature and Greco-Roman accounts like the *Periplus of the Erythraean Sea*. The convergence of these distinct archives—one textual, the other material—creates a powerful symbiosis, allowing for a far more robust and vivid reconstruction of ancient global trade networks than either could offer alone. The ruins and artifacts unearthed from the coastal silt are the physical proof of the worlds described in the poems and travelogues.

At **Puhar**, also known as **Kaveripoompattinam**, the legendary capital of the early Cholas, marine archaeological surveys have revealed submerged brick and stone structures offshore, suggesting the ancient city was far larger than its modern successor and was partially swallowed by the sea, as claimed in the epic *Manimekhalai*.30 Onshore excavations have uncovered a large, 'I'-shaped brick wharf, terracotta ring wells, and the remains of a Buddhist vihara, directly substantiating descriptions of port infrastructure and religious life found in Sangam texts like

*Pattinapalai*.30 These findings confirm Puhar's status as a major international emporium with extensive trade links reaching Southeast Asia and the Roman world.30

Similarly, the long-lost port of **Muziris**, celebrated in Sangam poetry as a bustling hub of the spice trade, has been identified with the archaeological site of **Pattanam** on the Kerala coast.34 Excavations have yielded a wealth of artifacts that testify to its global connections, including Roman amphorae (used for transporting wine and olive oil), glassware, gold coins, and West Asian pottery.34 The discovery of a wharf structure with wooden bollards for mooring ships provides a direct physical correlate to the poetic descriptions of Yavana (Roman/Greek) ships arriving with gold and leaving with pepper.35 The most definitive piece of evidence is the

**Muziris Papyrus**, a 2nd-century CE Greek commercial contract discovered in Egypt that meticulously details a loan agreement for a cargo shipment from Muziris to a Red Sea port, bringing the abstract notion of Indo-Roman trade into concrete, documented reality.35

On India's eastern and western coasts, other ports tell a similar story. **Tamralipta** in Bengal has been identified through archaeology and travelers' accounts as a critical gateway for trade and the dissemination of Buddhism to Southeast Asia.38

**Barygaza** (modern Bharuch) in Gujarat, extensively detailed in the *Periplus*, was a vital terminus connecting the overland trade routes of northern India with the maritime networks of the Western Indian Ocean.48 In each case, the material archive of archaeology breathes life into the textual archive of literature and history. The Roman coin found at Pattanam is not just an object; it is the physical remainder of the economic exchange sung about by the Sangam poets, a tangible link in the long chain of oceanic history.

#### **4.2 Ethnographic Soundings: Contemporary Lives on the Littoral**

While archaeology reveals the deep past of the Indic littorals, ethnography provides a crucial window into their living present. Studies of contemporary fishing communities offer a dynamic context for understanding the historical and literary archives, revealing the persistence of traditional knowledge and social structures while simultaneously highlighting their negotiation with the acute pressures of modernity. This ethnographic lens prevents a romanticized or static reading of the past, demonstrating that the littorals are not relics but are vibrant, contested zones where ancient ways of life continue to adapt and struggle.

Across India's coastline, these communities exhibit both remarkable continuity and profound change. In **Kerala**, the social fabric of fisherfolk is complex, with distinct religious and ethnic identities such as the Hindu Dheevaras (Arayans) and Latin Catholic Mukkuvas shaping communal life.36 Studies document the critical economic and social roles played by women, while also noting the constraints they face within deeply entrenched patriarchal systems.50 The community's relationship with the sea remains central, governed by a rich body of traditional ecological knowledge passed down through generations.51 At the same time, these communities have engaged with modern political structures, with figures like Catholic priests playing a key role in organizing fisher unions to advocate for their rights.52

In the **Bengal Sundarbans**, fishing communities inhabit a "hybrid landscape" where their traditional livelihoods are increasingly threatened by a convergence of modern crises.39 State-led conservation efforts, particularly the restrictions imposed by the Sundarban Tiger Reserve, have curtailed their access to ancestral fishing grounds.40 Simultaneously, they face environmental degradation from industrial pollution and the existential threat of climate change, which brings more frequent and intense cyclones.39 These contemporary struggles echo the environmental precarity depicted in

*Padma Nadir Majhi*, showing that the battle against a volatile ecology is an ongoing reality.

The coast of **Goa** presents another facet of this contested modernity. While fishing remains culturally central to all communities, ethnographic work has highlighted the unique socio-economic trajectory of Goan Catholic fisherwomen of the Kharvi community.27 Many have successfully transitioned from being "barefoot, headload peddlers" to becoming independent market entrepreneurs, a shift that has fostered more egalitarian gender relations and challenged traditional patriarchal norms.29 This case illustrates the agency of littoral communities in adapting to and shaping modern economic opportunities. Similarly, research in

**Tamil Nadu** shows the nuanced ways in which gender and class intersect to determine how individuals and families cope with modern regulations like seasonal fishing bans.33 These ethnographic soundings are vital; they ground the literary and historical narratives in the lived experiences of today, revealing the littoral not as a static backdrop for history, but as a dynamic frontline of contested modernity.

#### **4.3 A Syncretic Sea: Indic Connections to Swahili and Malay Worlds**

The Indic Ocean has never been a barrier; for millennia, it has been a vast conduit for a vibrant, multi-directional exchange of cultures, languages, goods, and ideas. This history of connection fostered a "vernacular cosmopolitanism" long before the onset of European-led globalization. The deeply syncretic cultures of the Swahili Coast in East Africa and the Malay Archipelago in Southeast Asia stand as powerful testaments to this pre-colonial globalized world, with their languages, religions, and material cultures bearing the indelible imprint of centuries of interaction with the Indian subcontinent.

The **Swahili Coast**, stretching along the shores of modern-day Kenya and Tanzania, emerged as a flourishing center of global trade networks that linked Africa to India, the Arabian Peninsula, and China.55 The resulting Swahili culture is a rich blend of its foundational African Bantu roots with Arab, Persian, and Indic influences.56 This syncretism is evident in its architecture, which incorporates materials like coral rock from the Red Sea, and most profoundly in its language, KiSwahili, a Bantu language whose lexicon is richly layered with loanwords from Arabic and other languages, including those from India.55 The very identity of the "Swahili"—an Arabic word for "people of the coast"—is a testament to a consciousness shaped by the sea and its connections.55

A similar story of deep historical interchange can be traced across the Bay of Bengal in the **Malay world**. Speakers of Malay and Tamil have been in sustained contact for roughly two millennia, a relationship that has resulted in extensive lexical borrowing and the formation of hybrid communities like the Jawi Peranakan and the Chitty of Malacca.57 The Malay literary tradition, particularly the poetic form of the

*pantun*, reflects a maritime character and a moral worldview shaped by the region's role as a global crossroads.58

This history of non-European globalization did not cease with the arrival of colonialism. As historian Nile Green has argued, the 19th century saw the emergence of a new "vernacular modernity" in the Indian Ocean.60 Centered in the colonial port city of Bombay, this phenomenon was powered by modern technologies like steam travel and vernacular printing. These tools were harnessed by ordinary people—migrant laborers and merchants—to create a dynamic "religious economy" that produced and exported a unique, syncretic "Bombay Islam" across the Western Indian Ocean to communities in South Africa and beyond.60 This history of the Indian Ocean provides a powerful counter-narrative to Eurocentric models of globalization. It reveals a world that was interconnected, multi-polar, and culturally fluid for centuries, a "pluriversal" space whose syncretic legacies continue to shape the identities of millions around its shores.

### **Part V: Conclusion: Towards a Bharatiya Renaissance \- Oceanic Thought and Decolonial Futures**

#### **5.1 Synthesizing the Archives: The Power of an Oceanic Consciousness**

This analysis has charted a course across diverse archives—literary, oral, material, and living—to argue for a fundamental reorientation in our understanding of Indic civilization. By weaving together the theoretical insights of an 'Ocean as Method' with the critical lens of 'Hydrocolonialism', it becomes possible to see the sea not as a periphery, but as a central, organizing principle of history. The Bhasha literatures of the coast, from the ancient Tamil *Neithal* poems to the modern novels of Kerala and Bengal, are revealed to be sophisticated vessels of memory, archiving the intricate relationship between human societies and their maritime ecologies. The oral traditions of the *Girmitiya* diaspora, carried across the *kala pani* in the form of *jahaji geet*, preserve a subaltern counter-narrative of colonial trauma and resilience. These textual and oral archives are not free-floating myths; they are anchored in the material world, corroborated by the archaeological unearthing of ancient port cities like Muziris and Puhar, and contextualized by the lived realities of contemporary fishing communities. Reading these archives in concert is a decolonial act. It reclaims a history that has been marginalized by terrestrial, nation-state-focused, and Eurocentric historiographies, asserting the power of an oceanic consciousness to reveal a more complex, interconnected, and accurate story of the past.

#### **5.2 From Kala Pani to Rainbow Waters: A Svarāj of Ideas**

This recovery of an oceanic past holds profound implications for the present and future. It provides the intellectual and historical foundation for a genuine "Bharatiya Renaissance"—one that is decolonial, outward-looking, and globally engaged. A true *Svarāj* of ideas, or intellectual self-reliance, cannot be achieved by clinging to a purely terrestrial, often inward-looking, definition of Bharatiya civilization.7 It requires embracing the full scope of its history, which has always been profoundly maritime. The ocean has been a space of both immense creativity and profound trauma, from the cosmopolitan emporia of the Sangam age to the hydrocolonial violence of the indenture ship.

To acknowledge this history is to move beyond a simplistic narrative of civilizational purity or victimhood. It is to recognize India not as a self-contained landmass that was a passive recipient of foreign influence, but as a central and dynamic node in a pluriversal network of exchange for millennia. This oceanic consciousness allows for a reframing of identity, one that is comfortable with syncretism, movement, and multi-directional flows of culture. It connects the struggles of a fisherman on the Padma River with the memories of a cane-cutter in Fiji, and the myths of *Kadalamma* with the syncretic cultures of the Swahili coast. This expansive, sea-facing vision is the necessary foundation for a decolonized and confident future, one that asserts its own modernity not in opposition to the world, but in deep, historical dialogue with it.

#### **5.3 A Digital Horizon: A Proposal for Future Research**

To translate this intellectual project into a tangible and enduring resource, a final, forward-looking step is proposed: the creation of a major Digital Humanities initiative. This project, tentatively titled "The Indic Ocean as Archive," would build directly on the research presented here. Its core would be a multilingual, open-access digital archive of the key Bhasha maritime texts, encoded using the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) standard to ensure interoperability and rich metadata.61 This would include annotated editions of the

*Neithal* poems, key passages from *Chemmeen* and *Padma Nadir Majhi*, and a collection of transcribed and translated *jahaji geet*.

This textual archive would be integrated with a powerful spatial component: an interactive historical Geographic Information System (GIS) map built on a platform like Leaflet or ArcGIS.62 This map would visualize the interconnected histories of the Indic Ocean, allowing users to plot and explore multiple layers of data: the locations of the ancient ports like Muziris and Tamralipta; the trade routes described in classical texts like the

*Periplus of the Erythraean Sea*; the harrowing diasporic routes of indenture ships sailing from Calcutta and Madras; and the sites of contemporary ethnographic research.64 By clicking on a point on the map—for example, the port of Muziris—a user could access the relevant archaeological data, excerpts from Sangam poetry describing the port, and ethnographic details of modern Keralan fishing communities. Such a project would make the "Ocean as Archive" a dynamic, interactive, and accessible tool for scholars, students, and the public, embodying the very principles of connection and multi-layered narrative that this report has sought to champion. It would be a digital vessel for an ancient oceanic memory, sailing toward a decolonial horizon.
