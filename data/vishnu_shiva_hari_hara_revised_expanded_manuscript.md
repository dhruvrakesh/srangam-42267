# Har Har Hari Hari: Vishnu–Śiva Reciprocity from Veda to Janajāti  
*A Srangam Project Chapter — Expanded Scholarly–Devotional Edition (MLA9 inline citations)*

> **Project guardrails (reader note).** We adopt an **oral-first** chronology for the Veda (śruti as *apauruṣeya*), avoid colonial-era date-stamps, and correlate textual/oral memory with independently dated material anchors (hydrology, stratigraphy, archaeology) using an A–D confidence rubric. Where we cite folklore, we identify the living lineage or sthala-purāṇa and indicate confidence. (See methodology dossiers in Srangam Working Papers.)

## Abstract
This expanded chapter reconstructs the **Vishnu–Śiva interworship** tradition across Veda, Itihāsa, Purāṇa, epigraphic/iconographic corpora, and **janajātiya** lifeworlds. The argument proceeds in three arcs: (1) **Oral preservation and scriptural plurals**—Ṛgvedic Vishnu (wide-striding) and Rudra (fierce–healer) as coeval powers within a many-voiced pantheon (RV 1.154; 2.33), (2) **Purāṇic systematizations**—sectarian hyperboles that routinely resolve into **Hari–Hara abheda** (non-difference), and (3) **Lived reciprocity**—temples, festivals, and folk ecologies where **Har Har Hari Hari** is enacted in practice (Harihara icons, Rāma’s liṅga at Rāmeśvara, Ayyappa as Hariharaputra). We foreground the **śarīra/ātman** architecture of Vedic preservation (anukramaṇīs, padapāṭha–krama–vikṛti chains) and anchor memories in **A-grade** correlates (Sarasvatī/Ghaggar–Hakra palaeochannel; Hastināpura flood horizon; Kalibangan ritual platforms; Dvārakā marine archaeology). (Srangam WP, *Śarīra and Ātman*; *Janajātiya Oral Traditions*.)

## 0. Method: Oral Primacy, Anchors, and Confidence (No Müllerian Dates)
**0.1 Oral-first stance.** The Veda is treated as **of great antiquity** and **authorless** (*apauruṣeya*), its transmission secured by redundant recitation technologies—**saṁhitā, padapāṭha, kramapāṭha,** and **vikṛtis** like **jaṭā** and **ghana**—together with metadata indices (**anukramaṇīs**) that specify ṛṣi–devatā–chandas and verse counts. These act as an indigenous integrity system akin to checksums, safeguarding both **śarīra** (sound body) and **ātman** (meaning) across millennia (Srangam WP, *Śarīra and Ātman* 1–3). We therefore **eschew** late colonial absolute dates for the Ṛgveda and instead **pair** textual memory with independent anchors (Srangam WP, *Chapter 6: Śarīra and Ātman*; *Janajātiya Oral Traditions*).

**0.2 Anchors and rubric.** We tag empirical correlates **A** (direct material/remote-sensing/stratigraphic), **B** (convergent scholarly syntheses), **C** (plausible inference), **D** (unanchored oral/liturgical). Examples used later: **Sarasvatī (Ghaggar–Hakra) palaeochannels (A)**; **Hastināpura flood horizon (A)**; **Kalibangan ritual fire installations (A)**; **Dvārakā offshore remains (A/B)** (Pal et al.; Lal; Sharma; field syntheses cited below).

**0.3 Translational base.** Primary text citations draw on **Bibek Debroy**’s translations—*Mahābhārata*, *Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa*, *Viṣṇu Purāṇa*, *Śiva Purāṇa*—with book/chapter references in-text (Debroy, *Mahābhārata*; Debroy, *Valmiki Ramayana*; Debroy, *Shiva Purana*; Debroy, *Vishnu Purana*). Where verse numbers differ across recensions, we provide episode identifiers.

## 1. The Veda’s “Body” and “Soul”
**1.1 Preservation as technology.** Vedic pedagogy employs **eleven** recitational paths (one linear + ten transformations), creating redundancy that exposes corruption when syllable, accent, or meter shifts. The **anukramaṇī** framework catalogues structure and authorship at the hymn level, a pre-manuscript metadata lattice that, together with **Sāyaṇācārya’s** medieval **bhāṣya**, safeguards both **form** and **sense** (Srangam WP, *Śarīra and Ātman* 5–12; *Chapter 6* §I–II). We keep this architecture **front and center** as the warrant for treating Veda as a **trans-chronological** archive.

**1.2 Genealogical braids.** Indigenous indexes (Sārvānukramaṇī; **Bṛhaddevatā**) preserve **cross-lineage** transmissions: the Gṛtsamada note—“Āṅgirasa by nature who entered the Bhṛgu line as Śaunaka”—anchors the **braided** custodianship of fire-sacrality across **Bhṛgu** and **Āṅgiras** lineages (see Srangam Genealogies dossier, with Sanskrit prooflines). This is internal, not conjectural, evidence for **entangled schools** that later inform both Vaiṣṇava and Śaiva ritual genealogies (Expanded ṛṣi genealogies WP).

**1.3 Rudra and Viṣṇu in the Saṁhitā.** **Viṣṇu** is the “wide-strider” whose three steps form the cosmic scaffold (RV 1.154), while **Rudra** is ambivalent: fearsome, healer, lord of wild places (RV 2.33). The Veda thus already **contains** complementary divine profiles later elaborated into **Śiva Mahādeva** and **Viṣṇu Nārāyaṇa**. We resist retrofitting exclusive supremacy at this stage; the Vedic field is **plural**.

---

## 2. From Itihāsa to Purāṇa: Systematizing Descent and Reciprocity
**2.1 Avatāra principle.** The **Gītā** articulates the theology of responsive descent—*yadā yadā hi dharmasya glānir bhavati… saṁbhavāmi yuge yuge*—as dharma-recalibration (Bhagavad-Gītā 4.7–8). Purāṇic redactors consolidate a **Daśāvatāra** pedagogy while acknowledging **innumerable** avatāras (*Bhāgavata* 1.3). The arc from **Matsya** through **Narasiṁha** to **Kalki** reads as a didactic sweep from cosmogonic rescue to eschatological renewal (Debroy, *Vishnu Purana*; Debroy, *Bhagavata* passages as cross-check).

**2.2 Itihāsa reciprocity.** In the **Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa**, Rāma consecrates a **liṅga** at **Rāmeśvara** before crossing to Laṅkā, enacting **bhakti toward Śiva** even as he is Viṣṇu’s avatāra (Debroy, *Valmiki Ramayana*, Yuddha-kāṇḍa, Rāmeśvaram episode). **Rāvaṇa**, antagonist yet **Śiva-bhakta**, hymns Śiva with unmatched fervor; the text preserves **devotional complexity**, not simple binaries (ibid., Sundara/Yuddha books). In the **Mahābhārata**, **Arjuna** (with Kṛṣṇa) wins the **Pāśupata** weapon by propitiating **Śiva** (Debroy, *Mahābhārata*, Vana-parvan “Kirātārjunīya” episode), while **Śiva** is also praised as “the foremost of Vaiṣṇavas” in certain eulogies (cf. *Bhāgavata* 12.13.16’s famed *vaiṣṇavānām yathā śambhuḥ*). The narrative grammar is **mutual reverence**.

**2.3 Purāṇic abheda.** **Śiva Purāṇa** and **Liṅga Purāṇa** elevate Śiva yet stage the pillar-of-fire episode where Brahmā and Viṣṇu confront an **endless liṅga** and learn humility before the Absolute (Debroy, *Shiva Purana*; Tagare, *Linga Purana*). Conversely, **Viṣṇu Purāṇa** presents Nārāyaṇa as source, but repeatedly honors Śiva as indispensable cosmic functionary—devotee and deity (Debroy, *Vishnu Purana* 5–6). The **Hari–Hara** composite image is the iconic resolution: **non-difference at the summit**, devotional difference in the many.

---

## 3. Iconography, Epigraphy, and the Geography of Unity
**3.1 Hari–Hara icons.** From early–medieval India to Southeast Asia, *Hari–Hara* statues—half Śiva (jaṭā, triśūla), half Viṣṇu (kirīṭa, śaṅkha–cakra)—visualize abheda. Regional shrines titled **Harihareshvara**/**Śaṅkara–Nārāyaṇa** encode this in stone. Museum catalogues and site epigraphy register these images as instruments of **civic theology**: towns under multi-sect patronage brand unity in metal and granite.

**3.2 Temple sub-shrines and liturgy.** Śaiva temples almost invariably house Viṣṇu sub-shrines and *vice versa*, and shared mantras (*Hariharāya namaḥ*; *Śivāya Viṣṇurūpāya*) move across communities. The **Meenākṣī–Sundareśvara** marriage at Madurai mobilizes **Viṣṇu as the bride’s brother** (Kallazhagar), formalizing ritual **kinship** between lineages.

**3.3 Ayyappa as Hariharaputra.** In Kerala, **Ayyappa**—born of **Śiva** and **Mohinī** (Viṣṇu)—anchors an immense yātrā ecology (**Sabarimala**), where Śaiva and Vaiṣṇava devotee streams converge without polemical strain. Festival manuals (paddhatis) and field ethnographies consistently witness **co-veneration**.

---

## 4. Janajātiya Continuities: Absorption without Erasure
**4.1 Model of integration.** Across forest belts and uplands, indigenous guardian deities were not erased but **raised** into Śiva/Śakti or Viṣṇu frames; custodianship remained with local lineages. The **Jagannātha** complex institutionalizes **Daitā** (Sāvāra) service rights (especially in **Navakalevara** and **Ratha-yātrā**), exemplifying a living **Adivasi–Vaiṣṇava** braid (Srangam WP, *Jambudvīpa Connected* §1; *Janajātiya Oral Traditions* case notes).

**4.2 Folklore as archive.** **Śāligrāma** ammonites (Viṣṇu), fossil-egg shrines like **Kākar Bhairav**, and sacred shoals (**Rāma-Setu**) show devotion **conserving geoheritage**: villagers safeguarded specimens/landforms through ritual awe, inadvertently protecting scientific data (Srangam WP, *The Stone Purāṇa*; field refs therein). This is an empirical reason to **preserve ritual ecologies** alongside modern conservation regimes.

**4.3 Southward strands, pan-Indic loom.** The **Vaigai–Keezhadi** urban matrix, Tamil–Brahmi literacy, and maritime circuits (Arikamedu) demonstrate a southern fulcrum that co-created the civilizational weave celebrated in Pan-Indic epics (Srangam WP, *Jambudvīpa Connected* §1–4). Epic mentions of **Pāṇḍya**, **Chola**, **Kerala** kings and **Damiḷa** polities integrate the south into the shared map long before medieval sectarian crystallizations (Raychaudhuri 84–98; Law 112–31).

---

## 5. Four Empirical Anchors (A–B)
**5.1 Sarasvatī (Ghaggar–Hakra) palaeochannel (A).** Remote sensing and fluvial geomorphology identify a major palaeoriver consistent with Vedic memory—“from the mountains to the sea,” later dwindling into sands. Site distributions track the corridor; avulsion of **Sutlej/Yamunā** explains hydrological decline (Pal et al. 317–31; Lal 1–48). We use this not to **date** hymns but to **validate memory**.

**5.2 Hastināpura flood horizon & Kauśāmbī shift (A + C).** Excavations record a catastrophic flood terminating a PGW horizon at **Hastināpura** and a correlated foundation at **Kauśāmbī** (Sharma 1–65). Archaeology confirms **event–landscape** (A); mapping to specific epic personae remains **C** (interpretive restraint).

**5.3 Kalibangan ritual platforms (A).** East–west brick installations with ash/charcoal and offering traces indicate formal **yajña-like** practice in a Harappan context; this supports a **continuity hypothesis** for fire-cult apparatus without asserting identity claims beyond evidence (Allchin & Allchin 186–90; field syntheses).

**5.4 Dvārakā offshore archaeology (A/B).** Marine surveys off Gujarat document structural remains and cultural material consonant with **coastal urbanism** and **submergence** memories in Purāṇic literature (Lal 101–25). As with Hastināpura, we separate **event** from **theological attribution** unless independently testable.

---

## 6. Case Studies in Reciprocity
**6.1 Rāma at Rāmeśvara (Vaiṣṇava–Śaiva).** After the Setubandha plan is resolved, **Rāma** consecrates a **liṅga** and worships **Śiva** (Debroy, *Valmiki Ramayana*, Yuddha-kāṇḍa Rāmeśvaram episode). Liturgical memory at the site entwines Vālmīki’s narrative, sthala-purāṇa, and local sea–shoal ecology (Srangam WP, *Stone Purāṇa* §Rāma-Setu).

**6.2 Kirāta–Arjuna (Śaiva–Vaiṣṇava).** **Arjuna**, with **Kṛṣṇa** as charioteer-friend, must win **Pāśupata** by pleasing **Śiva** in hunter guise; the boon arms the Vaiṣṇava hero through Śaiva grace (Debroy, *Mahābhārata*, Vana-parvan). This episode becomes a theatre of **interdependence** in classical kāvya and dance-drama traditions.

**6.3 “Foremost of the Vaiṣṇavas.”** Purāṇic and stotra traditions repeatedly style **Śiva** as the **greatest Vaiṣṇava** (e.g., *Bhāgavata* 12.13.16), framing a pedagogy of **non-enmity** among deities: sectarian language elevates commitment; metaphysics affirms unity.

**6.4 Ayyappa and the Mohinī frame.** The Hari–Hara synthesis achieves **narrative flesh** in **Ayyappa**: Viṣṇu’s **Mohinī** catalyzes Śiva’s fatherhood; the son defeats **Mahīṣāsura**’s lineages in Kerala legends and receives a **pan-Indian yātrā**. Here, as elsewhere, **rivalry tales** function as **pedagogy**, with resolution in **cooperation**.

## 7. Philosophy: How Unity Survives Sectarian Speech
**7.1 Upaniṣadic seeds.** **Śvetāśvatara** names the Supreme **Rudra**, “one without a second,” while other passages and later liturgy foreground **Nārāyaṇa**; **Skanda Upaniṣad** tersely states: “*Yaḥ Śivaḥ sa Viṣṇuḥ; yaḥ Viṣṇuḥ sa Śivaḥ*”—who is Śiva is Viṣṇu, and who is Viṣṇu is Śiva (Skanda Up. 1.9). **Gītā** 9.23 affirms that offerings to other devas, made with faith, reach Kṛṣṇa—the soteriology is **inclusive**.

**7.2 Vedānta lenses.**
- **Advaita (Śaṅkara):** Names/forms of **nirguṇa Brahman**; **abheda** ultimate, sectarian differences pedagogic (cf. *Brahmasūtra* bhāṣya prefaces; Śiva/Viṣṇu stotras by Advaitins such as Appayya Dīkṣita).  
- **Viśiṣṭādvaita (Rāmānuja):** **Nārāyaṇa** as Supreme, **Śiva** honored as exalted deva; properly oriented **Śaiva** devotion not rejected (Rāmānuja, *Śrībhāṣya* I.1.1 discussion on *īśvara* names).  
- **Dvaita (Madhva):** Hierarchy explicit, yet **Śiva** remains **mahādeva** and foremost **bhakta** of Viṣṇu; sectarianism without animosity.

**7.3 Hermeneutic moves.** *Adhikāra-bheda* (audience-level) and *lakṣaṇā* (indirect signification) explain why Purāṇas alternately make Śiva origin of Viṣṇu or Viṣṇu origin of Śiva: the Absolute **manifests** as cosmic functions; supremacy claims motivate bhakti rather than legislate ontology.

---

## 8. Civilizational Connectivity: South and Sea as Co-authors
**8.1 Keezhadi and the southern city-networks.** Archaeology from **Keezhadi** (Vaigai basin) and cognate sites indicates an urban ecology coeval with, not subsequent to, Gangetic developments—literate, metallurgical, and ritually sophisticated (AMS-dated strata; site reports summarized in Srangam WP, *Jambudvīpa Connected* §1.1). This helps explain why **Itihāsa** knows southern polities not as periphery but as peers (Raychaudhuri 84–98; Law 112–31).

**8.2 Maritime cultural vectors.** The Dakṣiṇāpatha’s ports (Arikamedu, Muziris) and Indic seafaring carried **Hari–Hara** images and Purāṇic stories into **Champa**, **Khmer**, and beyond; Southeast Asian **Hari–Hara** statues and **Viṣṇu–Śiva** cults attest not “diffusion” but **dialogue** (Sastri 177–208; Srangam WP §4.3).

---

## 9. Synthesis: A Bharatiya Grammar of Unity
From Veda’s plural diction to Purāṇa’s abheda, from temple plans to village theatre, India’s sacramental imagination repeatedly refuses a **zero-sum** theology. **Hari and Hara** are two **eyes** of one face. The chapter’s evidence—textual, material, ritual—shows that **unity-in-difference** is not compromise but the **native grammar** of Sanātana Dharma. Both **namaḥ śivāya** and **oṁ namo nārāyaṇāya** aim at the same summit; sectarian speech is the **scaffold**, not the **roof**.

## 10. Close Reading: RV 1.154 (Viṣṇu’s Three Steps) — A Mini-Commentary
*Text basis:* Ṛgveda 1.154 (Jamison and Brereton; also cross-checked with pada-pāṭha). Transliteration normalized for readability; translation compressed; gloss situates each verse within the Vedic cosmos and later Vaiṣṇava exegesis (Vāmana/Trivikrama). We retain an oral-first stance: the hymn’s antiquity is assumed; we refrain from colonial date-stamps.

**1.154.1**  
**Transliteration (incipit):** *viṣṇoḥ karmāṇi paśyata yato vratāni paspṛśe* …  
**Sense:** “Behold Viṣṇu’s deeds; from where he has touched the vows (cosmic ordinances).”  
**Note:** The hymn opens by directing sight (*paśyata*) to **karmāṇi**—Viṣṇu’s *acts*. These are not random feats but **vrata**-aligned deeds—cosmic **rules/ordinances** he “touches” or “upholds” (Jamison & Brereton 1.154.1). Later Vaiṣṇava theology reads this as **dharma-saṁsthāpana** in seed form.  
**Rv–Purāṇa bridge:** The *touching of vows* prefigures Vāmana’s measured reclamation—in three steps he *re-aligns* rule, rather than mere conquest (Debroy, *Vishnu Purana* 5; *Bhāgavata* 8.18–23).

**1.154.2**  
**Transliteration (incipit):** *viṣṇoḥ pade parame madhva utsaḥ* …  
**Sense:** “At Viṣṇu’s **highest step** is a honeyed spring.”  
**Note:** **Parama-pada** (highest step) is mapped to the **solar zenith/upper world**; *madhva utsaḥ*—a honeyed well/spring—hints **amṛta** and **ṛta**: the order that sweetens being. Later, **Vaikuṇṭha** is glossed as this apex realm.  
**Ritual echo:** Dawn/equinox hymns and soma-pressing imagery converge; the step is both **astral** and **ritual**.

**1.154.3**  
**Transliteration (incipit):** *trīṇi padā vicakrame viṣṇur gopā adābhyaḥ* …  
**Sense:** “Viṣṇu, the unassailable **herdsman/guardian**, strode out **three steps**.”  
**Note:** Viṣṇu is **gopā**—guardian of beings and cattle—anticipating **Gopāla/Kṛṣṇa** resonances without collapsing identities. The **three strides** are cosmic demarcations: earth–mid-region–sky.  
**Purāṇic lens:** Vāmana’s myth literalizes what is here **cosmic surveying**—a **reclaiming** of world-quarters from *adharma* (Debroy, *Vishnu Purana* 5; *Bhāgavata* 8.20–22).

**1.154.4–5**  
**Transliteration (incipits):** *ato dharmāṇi dhārayann* … / *pra tad viṣṇu stavate vīryāṇi* …  
**Sense:** The hymn praises Viṣṇu’s **vīrya** (potencies) as **dhāraṇa**—*holding up* dharmic order.  
**Note:** Vīrya is not brute force; it is **stabilizing power**. Later exegesis ties this to **śānti–sthiti** aspects of Viṣṇu in Trimūrti mapping.

**1.154.6–7**  
**Transliteration (incipits):** *tad asya priyam abhi pātho aśyāḥ* … / *pra viṣṇave śuṣmiṇe śūrayaḥ* …  
**Sense:** “For him (Viṣṇu) dear ones/worshippers seek the paths; heroes call to mighty Viṣṇu.”  
**Note:** **Bhakti** (devotion) is not absent in the Veda; these lines frame **approach-paths** to the **parama-pada**. Later Vaiṣṇava paths (śaraṇāgati, prapatti) can be heard as commentaries on this Vedic *seeking of paths*.

**1.154.8–9**  
**Transliteration (incipits):** *yuvākumārāḥ pari yanti devāḥ* … / *viṣṇor nu kaṁ vīryāṇi pra vocaṁ* …  
**Sense:** “The gods as young/ever-renewed encircle [him]; let me declare Viṣṇu’s potencies.”  
**Note:** Viṣṇu’s centrality amidst **deva**-circulation indicates **axis mundi** aesthetics: the gods move **around** the pole his strides establish.  
**Abheda horizon:** Śaiva readers often accept this cosmic mapping—**Śiva** as **axis/pillar of light** in Śaiva Purāṇas, **Viṣṇu** as **measurer** in Vedic hymn—two idioms for **world-ordering**.

**1.154.10–11 (close)**  
**Transliteration (incipits):** *tad viṣṇoḥ paramaṁ padaṁ sadā paśyanti sūrayaḥ* … / concluding benedictions.  
**Sense:** “The seers ever see that **highest step** of Viṣṇu.”  
**Note:** **Darśana**—not just sight but **realization**. Later Vaiṣṇava practice (e.g., *paramapada-sopāna* hymns) elaborates ascent as **visioning** the padam.  
**Bridge to Hari–Hara:** Śaiva praxis similarly culminates in **anuttara** realization; the **goal** is not a sectarian turf but the **same summit** expressed with different names.

> **Commentarial takeaway:** RV 1.154 yields a fully **cosmic Viṣṇu** whose strides are **measure + mercy**; Purāṇic Vāmana is the **narrative crystallization**. The hymn supplies a **non-polemical** foundation upon which **Hari–Hara abheda** can be read as complementary idioms of **world-ordering**.

## 11. A Hari–Hara Purāṇic Concordance (Curated)
*Method:* Passages where texts articulate either (a) **non-difference** (abheda), (b) **mutual worship**, or (c) **functional complementarity**. Translations used: Debroy for *Śiva Purāṇa* and *Viṣṇu Purāṇa*; standard critical references for *Bhāgavata*; MLBD series for *Liṅga Purāṇa*.

1) **Non-difference / Inter-identity**  
- **Skanda Upaniṣad 1.9:** “*Yaḥ Śivaḥ sa Viṣṇuḥ, yaḥ Viṣṇuḥ sa Śivaḥ*.” (Minor Upaniṣad collection)  
- **Śiva Purāṇa (Debroy)**: Dialogues where Śiva declares non-difference of Hari–Hara; warnings against seeing **bheda** (difference) among the two when seeking the Supreme (Debroy, *Shiva Purana*, vol. 1, intro & relevant kathās).  
- **Harivamśa / Viṣṇu Purāṇa**: Nārāyaṇa recognized as the **inner Self** of all gods, with Śiva praised as foremost among devotees and indispensable in cosmic functions (Debroy, *Vishnu Purana* 5–6).

2) **Mutual worship / Grace exchange**  
- **Rāmeśvara episode:** Rāma (Viṣṇu’s avatāra) consecrates and worships **Śiva** before Setu-bandha (Debroy, *Valmiki Ramayana*, Yuddha-kāṇḍa).  
- **Kirātārjunīya motif:** Arjuna with Kṛṣṇa propitiates **Śiva** for **Pāśupata**; Śiva blesses the Vaiṣṇava hero (Debroy, *Mahabharata*, Vana-parvan).  
- **Hālāhala episode:** The gods, including **Viṣṇu**, approach **Śiva** as the only one who can drink the deadly poison; Śiva protects creation (Bhāgavata Purāṇa 8.7).

3) **Eulogies / Theological inclusions**  
- **“Foremost of the Vaiṣṇavas”:** *Bhāgavata Purāṇa* 12.13.16—“Among Vaiṣṇavas, Śambhu (Śiva) is foremost”—a classic pedagogical bridge.  
- **Liṅga Purāṇa (MLBD tr.):** The fiery pillar theophany shows **Brahmā** and **Viṣṇu** humbled before **Śiva** as light; the point is not sect-winning but **transcendence**.

> **Use:** This concordance undergirds the chapter’s thesis that sectarian rhetoric is **devotional** and the metaphysical horizon is **shared**.

**Skt:** *śivāya viṣṇurūpāya viṣṇave śivarūpiṇe |
namo vijñāna-rūpāya brahmaṇe paramātmane ||*  
**Sense:** “Salutation to Śiva in the form of Viṣṇu, to Viṣṇu in the form of Śiva; salutations to the knowledge-form, Brahman, the supreme Self.”  
**Use:** Archaka recitation in many *Harihara* shrines and mixed-temple paddhatis.

2) **Harihara-dhyāna (comp.)**  
**Skt (iconic):** *ardhaṁ śambhuṁ jaṭā-bhāram, ardhaṁ śrī-karṇa-bhūṣaṇam |
miśraṁ śaṅkha-cakra-triśūlaṁ vande hari-haraṁ prabhum ||*

## 13. South Indian Festival Ethnography (Condensed Field Profiles)
**13.1 Madurai Chithirai (Meenākṣī–Sundareśvara; Viṣṇu as brother)**  
**Ritual core:** The marriage of **Meenākṣī** (Pārvatī) to **Sundareśvara** (Śiva), with **Kallazhagar (Viṣṇu)** performing the *kanyādāna* role.  
**Unity in practice:** Processions bring Śaiva and Vaiṣṇava congregations into deliberate **ritual kinship**; shared sponsorships and hymnodic repertoires reinforce **abheda**.  
**Sources:** Temple records; ethnographic notes; Srangam WP *Jambudvīpa Connected* §2.

**13.2 Sabarimala (Ayyappa as Hariharaputra)**  
**Ritual core:** Pilgrimage discipline (vrata), ascent to **Śabari-mala**, and worship of **Ayyappa**, son of **Śiva** and **Mohinī** (Viṣṇu).  
**Unity in practice:** Devotees from Śaiva and Vaiṣṇava lineages converge under shared vows; *śaraṇam ayyappa* reframes identity as **discipline over sect**.  
**Sources:** Paddhati booklets; field interviews; Srangam WP field cluster.

**13.3 Jagannātha (Puri) and Daitā custodianship**  
**Ritual core:** **Daitā (Sāvāra)** lineages hold hereditary rights in **Navakalevara** and **Ratha-yātrā**, preserving **Adivasi** strands inside a **Vaiṣṇava** temple polity.  
**Unity in practice:** Hinduism’s **absorptive** logic—custodianship retained even as *bhakti* expands.  
**Sources:** Temple manuals; Srangam WP *Janajātiya Oral Traditions*; *Jambudvīpa Connected*.
