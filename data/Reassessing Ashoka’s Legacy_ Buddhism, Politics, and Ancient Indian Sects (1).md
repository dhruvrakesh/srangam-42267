# **Reassessing Ashoka’s Legacy: Buddhism, Politics, and Ancient Indian Sects**

## **Shramana Dominance in Magadha Before the Mauryas**

From the 6th to 4th centuries BCE, the Magadha region was a hotbed of **Śramaṇa** traditions – spiritual movements outside Vedic orthodoxy. Both **Buddhism** and **Jainism** thrived under early Magadhan kings. King **Bimbisara** (r. 544–492 BCE) of the Haryanka dynasty, for example, expanded Magadha and **patronized the Buddha**, famously gifting the Veluvana (bamboo grove) for a Buddhist monastery[*\[1\]*](https://tathastuics.com/article/dynasties-haryanka-shishunaga-nanda-a-chronological-exploration#:~:text=,for%20the%20establishment%20of%20monasteries). His son **Ajātashatru** continued this patronage of the Buddhist Saṅgha and also supported Jain monks[*\[2\]*](https://tathastuics.com/article/dynasties-haryanka-shishunaga-nanda-a-chronological-exploration#:~:text=of%20a%20new%20fort%20at,to%20the%20spread%20of%20Buddhism). The succeeding Shishunaga rulers likewise fostered these heterodox faiths – King **Kālaśoka** even hosted the Second Buddhist Council at Vaiśālī[*\[3\]*](https://tathastuics.com/article/dynasties-haryanka-shishunaga-nanda-a-chronological-exploration#:~:text=,decline%20of%20the%20Shishunaga%20dynasty). In contrast to the Vedic Brahmanism of other regions, **Magadha’s religious landscape was dominated by these non-Vedic sects**. As scholar Johannes Bronkhorst has noted, a “rival culture” of Buddhism/Jainism **“dominated the eastern Gangetic plain during the early Buddhist period,”** with orthodox Brahmins a distinct minority in Magadha[*\[4\]*](https://en.dharmapedia.net/wiki/Magadha#:~:text=culture%20of%20Greater%20Magadha%20which,15). This climate allowed *Śramaṇa* ideas – renunciation, karma, rebirth sans caste dogma – to flourish broadly.

By the time of the **Nanda dynasty** (c. 345–322 BCE), Magadha’s rulers themselves leaned into Śramaṇa beliefs. The Nandas, famed for their wealth and power, appear to have been **strong Jain adherents**. The 1st-century BCE Hathigumpha inscription of Kalinga’s King Kharavela records that a Nanda king **removed a revered Jaina idol from Kalinga to Pataliputra** (Magadha’s capital)[*\[5\]*](https://jainworld.com/literature/jain-history/historical-role-of-jainism/#:~:text=Jainism%20appears%20to%20have%20been,was%20the%20follower%20of%20Jainism). This act not only attests to early Jain sculptural art, but also implies **the Nanda monarch followed Jainism***[\[6\]*](https://jainworld.com/literature/jain-history/historical-role-of-jainism/#:~:text=king%20removed%20the%20Jaina%20image,was%20the%20follower%20of%20Jainism). Jain historical texts corroborate that **Jainism was dominant in Magadha under the Nandas**, with Jain ministers guiding state affairs[*\[7\]*](https://jainworld.com/literature/jain-history/historical-role-of-jainism/#:~:text=According%20to%20Jaina%20tradition%2C%20the,6)*[\[8\]](https://jainworld.com/literature/jain-history/historical-role-of-jainism/#:~:text=That%20the%20Jainas%20were%20powerful,7)*. Indeed, the Sanskrit play *Mudrārākṣasa*, which dramatizes Chandragupta’s rise, depicts Jains as prominent figures at the Nanda court and even as secret envoys working with Chanakya[*\[8\]*](https://jainworld.com/literature/jain-history/historical-role-of-jainism/#:~:text=That%20the%20Jainas%20were%20powerful,7). In sum, **by the end of Nanda rule, heterodox ascetic traditions – Buddhist, Jain, and other Śramaṇas – held sway in Magadha’s cultural and religious life**, overshadowing the old Vedic rites[*\[4\]*](https://en.dharmapedia.net/wiki/Magadha#:~:text=culture%20of%20Greater%20Magadha%20which,15).

## **Early Mauryan Religious Affiliations: Chandragupta and Bindusāra**

The Mauryan Empire (321–185 BCE) rose on the ashes of Nanda rule, but it inherited Magadha’s pluralistic religious milieu. Founder **Chandragupta Maurya** overthrew Dhana Nanda in 322 BCE, aided by the wily Brahmin Chanakya, yet Chandragupta’s own religious leanings were eclectic. Jain sources maintain that late in life Chandragupta renounced his throne, embraced Jain monasticism under Bhadrabāhu, and fasted to death in Śravaṇabeḷagoḷa[*\[9\]*](https://jainworld.com/literature/jain-history/historical-role-of-jainism/#:~:text=Jainism%20was%20dominant%20in%20Magadha,large%20number%20of%20people%20accepted). Whether fully historical or not, this tradition underscores the **influence of Jainism at the Mauryan court’s outset**. Chandragupta’s imperial successor, **Bindusāra** (r. 297–273 BCE), is more concretely linked to another Śramaṇa sect: the **Ājīvikas**. According to chronicles, Bindusāra “was reputedly an Ajivika adherent” who remained devoted to that sect’s strict fatalist philosophy despite the presence of Buddhists and Jains at court[*\[10\]*](https://noblechatter.com/faq/4941/ajivika/did-any-major-historical-figures-or-rulers-support-the-ajivikas#:~:text=Even%20before%20Ashoka%E2%80%99s%20reign%2C%20Bindusara%E2%80%94Chandragupta%E2%80%99s,Buddhism%20and%20Jainism%20at%20court). This is borne out by archaeology – the earliest Mauryan cave dedications in the Barabar Hills were not to Buddhists but to Ājīvika ascetics. Inscriptions from \~250 BCE show Bindusāra’s son **Aśoka** (as “Devanampriya”) **donated the Lomas Rishi Cave to Ājīvika monks**, and Aśoka’s grandson Dasharatha later endowed additional caves for “all followers of the Ājīvika sect”[*\[11\]*](https://noblechatter.com/faq/4941/ajivika/did-any-major-historical-figures-or-rulers-support-the-ajivikas#:~:text=Several%20Mauryan%20emperors%20lent%20the,%E2%80%9D)*[\[12\]](https://noblechatter.com/faq/4941/ajivika/did-any-major-historical-figures-or-rulers-support-the-ajivikas#:~:text=Priyadarshi%E2%80%9D%20,%E2%80%9D)*. Such royal patronage suggests that **Ājīvikas enjoyed high favor during Bindusāra’s reign**, likely **peaking in influence under Bindusāra**’s rule[*\[13\]*](https://indianexpress.com/article/parenting/learning/ancient-indian-philosophers-agnostic-ajiviks-5778424/#:~:text=Ajiviks%20were%20quite%20influential%2C%20and,for%20most%20of%20his%20life). Meanwhile, Buddhism during this early Mauryan period did not yet enjoy exclusive patronage; it was one of several competing sects in the empire’s religious tapestry[*\[10\]*](https://noblechatter.com/faq/4941/ajivika/did-any-major-historical-figures-or-rulers-support-the-ajivikas#:~:text=Even%20before%20Ashoka%E2%80%99s%20reign%2C%20Bindusara%E2%80%94Chandragupta%E2%80%99s,Buddhism%20and%20Jainism%20at%20court).

Thus, on the eve of Aśoka’s accession, **Magadha’s spiritual landscape was diverse and contested**. Jainism had been powerful under the Nandas[*\[9\]*](https://jainworld.com/literature/jain-history/historical-role-of-jainism/#:~:text=Jainism%20was%20dominant%20in%20Magadha,large%20number%20of%20people%20accepted); an Ajivika-oriented emperor (Bindusāra) had just passed, and **Buddhism, while present, was not yet the primary court-supported faith**. This would change dramatically under Aśoka.

## **Aśoka’s Embrace of Buddhism – Political Calculation and Patronage**

Emperor **Aśoka** (r. 268–232 BCE) is famously remembered as the patron of Buddhism who spread Dharma across Asia. However, recent historical analyses suggest **Aśoka’s conversion to Buddhism was as much a political act as a spiritual awakening**. Notably, Aśoka’s conversion *preceded* his most infamous military campaign. He fought and won the **Kalinga War in 261 BCE**, but **rock edicts confirm he had adopted Buddhism over two years earlier***[\[14\]*](https://www.hindustantimes.com/books/this-excerpt-from-a-new-book-demolishes-emperor-ashoka-reputation-as-a-pacifist/story-puxXlUpPsDy4TqELZ3UonN.html#:~:text=pacifist,felt%20for%20sufferings%20of%20war). There is **“no Buddhist text”** linking his conversion to the war’s horror, and even Aśoka’s biographers (such as British author Charles Allen) agree the emperor was already a declared Buddhist by the time of Kalinga[*\[14\]*](https://www.hindustantimes.com/books/this-excerpt-from-a-new-book-demolishes-emperor-ashoka-reputation-as-a-pacifist/story-puxXlUpPsDy4TqELZ3UonN.html#:~:text=pacifist,felt%20for%20sufferings%20of%20war). Why, then, did Aśoka turn to Buddhism?

Historians like Sanjeev Sanyal argue that the context of **Aśoka’s bloody succession struggle** holds the key. Aśoka seized power by eliminating rival brothers in a brutal civil war (earning him the epithet **“Chanda-Aśoka” or Aśoka the Cruel)***[\[15\]*](https://www.hindustantimes.com/books/this-excerpt-from-a-new-book-demolishes-emperor-ashoka-reputation-as-a-pacifist/story-puxXlUpPsDy4TqELZ3UonN.html#:~:text=killed%20all%20male%20rivals%20in,crowned%20emperor%20in%20270%20BC). Many of those rivals and disaffected nobles were aligned with **Jains and Ājīvikas**, given the Mauryan court’s recent orientation[*\[16\]*](https://www.hindustantimes.com/books/this-excerpt-from-a-new-book-demolishes-emperor-ashoka-reputation-as-a-pacifist/story-puxXlUpPsDy4TqELZ3UonN.html#:~:text=the%20Jains%20in%20old%20age,carried%20out%20by%20Brahmin%20priests)*[\[17\]](https://www.hindustantimes.com/books/this-excerpt-from-a-new-book-demolishes-emperor-ashoka-reputation-as-a-pacifist/story-puxXlUpPsDy4TqELZ3UonN.html#:~:text=It%20is%20likely%20that%20when,that%20was%20no%20longer%20trusted)*. **Aśoka likely reached for Buddhist support as a counterweight**, to legitimize his rule and rally a new loyal base[*\[17\]*](https://www.hindustantimes.com/books/this-excerpt-from-a-new-book-demolishes-emperor-ashoka-reputation-as-a-pacifist/story-puxXlUpPsDy4TqELZ3UonN.html#:~:text=It%20is%20likely%20that%20when,that%20was%20no%20longer%20trusted). In other words, the embattled new emperor sided with the Buddhists – a rising rival sect to Jain/Ājīvika interests – to consolidate power. This theory is supported by the political moves that followed. Aśoka gave key appointments to Buddhist advisors and married Devi, a Buddhist from Vidisha (according to tradition), strengthening ties with the Buddhist community. Sanyal suggests even **Aśoka’s invasion of Kalinga may have had a political motive related to this internal power struggle**: Kalinga, which had been a vassal or province since the Nanda era[*\[18\]*](https://www.hindustantimes.com/books/this-excerpt-from-a-new-book-demolishes-emperor-ashoka-reputation-as-a-pacifist/story-puxXlUpPsDy4TqELZ3UonN.html#:~:text=We%20know%20that%20the%20Nandas%2C,and%20my%20guess%20is%20that), possibly **sided with Aśoka’s enemies during the succession war**, prompting his attack to stamp out a rebel ally[*\[19\]*](https://swarajyamag.com/magazine/the-truth-about-ashoka#:~:text=It%20is%20likely%20that%20when,view%20is%20that%20Kalinga%20was)*[\[20\]](https://swarajyamag.com/magazine/the-truth-about-ashoka#:~:text=obviously%20changed%20during%20the%20early,itself%20independent%20in%20the%20confusion)*.

Once in power, Aśoka unmistakably became **Buddhism’s greatest royal patron**. He poured state resources into the Buddhist Saṅgha, **using his “vast winnings” from war to support monks, stupas, schools, and missions***[\[21\]*](https://www.eurasiareview.com/05082013-decline-of-buddhism-in-ancient-and-medieval-india-analysis/#:~:text=Under%20Ashoka%2C%20Buddhism%20spread%20widely,sources%20determined%20the%20ultimate%20outcome). Royal missionaries were sent to distant lands – Aśoka’s inscriptions boast of spreading Dharma as far as the Hellenistic Mediterranean, Tamil South India, and Sri Lanka[*\[22\]*](https://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/dhammika/wheel386.html#:~:text=Now%20it%20is%20conquest%20by,not%20been%2C%20these%20people%20too)*[\[23\]](https://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/dhammika/wheel386.html#:~:text=borders%2C%20even%20six%20hundred%20yojanas,and%20will%20continue%20to%20do)*. According to the *Mahāvaṃsa*, he dispatched his own son (Mahinda) and daughter (Sanghamitta) to propagate Buddhism in Sri Lanka, where Aśoka forged a close alliance with the Buddhist king Tissa[*\[21\]*](https://www.eurasiareview.com/05082013-decline-of-buddhism-in-ancient-and-medieval-india-analysis/#:~:text=Under%20Ashoka%2C%20Buddhism%20spread%20widely,sources%20determined%20the%20ultimate%20outcome). He convened a great council (Third Buddhist Council, as later tradition calls it) in Pataliputra to purify the Saṅgha. The **rock and pillar edicts** Aśoka issued across his empire – the first tangible evidence of Buddhism as an imperial ideology – **extol moral precepts (Dharma)** and religious tolerance in principle. In practice, Aśoka openly favored Buddhists: he granted land and tax exemptions to monasteries and built84,000 stupas (as per legend). Under Aśoka’s nearly 40-year reign, **Buddhism transitioned from a regional sect to a truly pan-Indian religion backed by imperial might***[\[21\]*](https://www.eurasiareview.com/05082013-decline-of-buddhism-in-ancient-and-medieval-india-analysis/#:~:text=Under%20Ashoka%2C%20Buddhism%20spread%20widely,sources%20determined%20the%20ultimate%20outcome). This **“conquest by Dhamma”** as Aśoka called it was intended to bind his far-flung empire ethically in the aftermath of military conquests[*\[22\]*](https://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/dhammika/wheel386.html#:~:text=Now%20it%20is%20conquest%20by,not%20been%2C%20these%20people%20too)*[\[24\]](https://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/dhammika/wheel386.html#:~:text=the%20Nabhakas%2C%20the%20Nabhapamkits%2C%20the,world%20to%20be%20more%20important)*.

Yet Aśoka’s self-portrayal as a righteous, compassionate ruler demands closer scrutiny – especially the famous story of his remorse after Kalinga.

## **The Kalinga War and the Myth of Aśoka’s Remorse**

Classical narratives depict the **Kalinga war** (261 BCE) as the turning point that transformed “Ashoka the Cruel” into a pacifist Buddhist. According to popular lore, the appalling bloodshed – Aśoka’s own records say **100,000 were slain and 150,000 deported***[\[25\]*](https://www.hindustantimes.com/books/this-excerpt-from-a-new-book-demolishes-emperor-ashoka-reputation-as-a-pacifist/story-puxXlUpPsDy4TqELZ3UonN.html#:~:text=Archaeologists%20have%20only%20excavated%20a,were%20taken%20away%20as%20captives)*[\[26\]](https://swarajyamag.com/magazine/the-truth-about-ashoka#:~:text=Mauryan%20army,were%20taken%20away%20as%20captives)* – filled him with regret. He supposedly renounced violence, embraced Dharma, and ruled benevolently thereafter. However, **epigraphic evidence and critical scholarship reveal this pious conversion tale to be largely a later fabrication***[\[27\]*](https://swarajyamag.com/magazine/the-truth-about-ashoka#:~:text=,include%20clear%20threats%20of%20violence)*[\[28\]](https://swarajyamag.com/magazine/the-truth-about-ashoka#:~:text=he%20was%20known%20as%20%E2%80%9CChandashoka%E2%80%9D,discover%20that%20the%20popular%20narrative)*.

First, as noted, **Aśoka was already a practicing Buddhist before the war***[\[29\]*](https://swarajyamag.com/magazine/the-truth-about-ashoka#:~:text=match%20at%20L199%20about%20this,Allen%20agree%20that%20his%20conversion), so the war did not cause an overnight conversion. More telling is what Aśoka’s own **inscriptions (edict XIII in particular) actually say**. In his rock edicts installed *after* Kalinga, Aśoka does express sorrow for the massive loss of life, stating that **the slaughter and deportations “now pain \[him\] deeply”***[\[30\]*](https://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/dhammika/wheel386.html#:~:text=There%20is%20no%20country%2C%20except,forgiven%20where%20forgiveness%20is%20possible). He proclaims that **“even those who do wrong should be forgiven where possible”***[\[31\]*](https://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/dhammika/wheel386.html#:~:text=deportation%20of%20a%20hundredth%2C%20or,forgiven%20where%20forgiveness%20is%20possible). This sounds like genuine remorse. Yet, notably, these statements of regret **do not appear uniformly** on all edict copies – they are omitted in the versions found in Kalinga itself (Odisha). In fact, the inscriptions **set up in Kalinga (at Dhauli and Jaugada) pointedly exclude any mention of Aśoka’s regret or apology to the Kalingans***[\[32\]*](https://www.hindustantimes.com/books/this-excerpt-from-a-new-book-demolishes-emperor-ashoka-reputation-as-a-pacifist/story-puxXlUpPsDy4TqELZ3UonN.html#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20official%20storyline%2C,regret%20is%20deliberately%20left%20out)*[\[33\]](https://www.hindustantimes.com/books/this-excerpt-from-a-new-book-demolishes-emperor-ashoka-reputation-as-a-pacifist/story-puxXlUpPsDy4TqELZ3UonN.html#:~:text=translations%20put%20up%20by%20the,The%20silence%20is%20deafening)*. This deliberate omission suggests Aśoka was perhaps **unwilling to display contrition to the very people he had conquered**, raising doubts about the sincerity of his compassion. Historian S. Sanyal observes that the *only* remorseful inscriptions are located far from Kalinga (e.g. in Shahbazgarhi, present-day Pakistan), whereas **“none of the inscriptions in Odisha express any remorse; any hint of regret is deliberately left out – the silence is deafening.”***[\[34\]*](https://www.hindustantimes.com/books/this-excerpt-from-a-new-book-demolishes-emperor-ashoka-reputation-as-a-pacifist/story-puxXlUpPsDy4TqELZ3UonN.html#:~:text=his%20repentance%20comes%20from%20his,regret%20is%20deliberately%20left%20out)*[\[35\]](https://www.hindustantimes.com/books/this-excerpt-from-a-new-book-demolishes-emperor-ashoka-reputation-as-a-pacifist/story-puxXlUpPsDy4TqELZ3UonN.html#:~:text=Read%20more%3A%20Saeed%20Naqvi%20on,of%20the%20Muslim%20in%20India)*.

Even where Aśoka’s edicts profess regret, they come **tinged with veiled threats**. One edict urges the people of the forested frontiers (the “Atavikas”) to behave, warning that **“Despite his remorse, Beloved-of-the-Gods \[Aśoka\] has the power to punish them if necessary”***[\[36\]*](https://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/dhammika/wheel386.html#:~:text=Even%20the%20forest%20people%2C%20who,where%20wrong%20has%20been%20done)*[\[37\]](https://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/dhammika/wheel386.html#:~:text=Even%20the%20forest%20people%2C%20who,Gods)*. Aśoka adds that these forest tribes should feel shame for their misconduct “*so that they may not be killed*”[*\[36\]*](https://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/dhammika/wheel386.html#:~:text=Even%20the%20forest%20people%2C%20who,where%20wrong%20has%20been%20done). In other words, the emperor’s *Dhamma* still allowed use of the sword against recalcitrants. This hardly reflects total renunciation of violence – **even in the same breath as his regret, Aśoka reminds subjects that he can enforce his will militarily**. The **clear threat of violence** in Aśoka’s “supposedly regretful inscriptions” was highlighted by Sanyal: far from being uniformly pacifist, Aśoka explicitly **warns that he would punish troublemakers “in spite of his repentance.”***[\[38\]*](https://www.hindustantimes.com/books/this-excerpt-from-a-new-book-demolishes-emperor-ashoka-reputation-as-a-pacifist/story-puxXlUpPsDy4TqELZ3UonN.html#:~:text=If%20Ashoka%20was%20genuinely%20remorseful%2C,ashamed%20of%20their%20crimes%20and)*[\[27\]](https://swarajyamag.com/magazine/the-truth-about-ashoka#:~:text=,include%20clear%20threats%20of%20violence)*. If Aśoka had truly undergone a spiritual epiphany of non-violence, we would expect him at least to pardon the Kalingan prisoners or offer restitution. **In reality, he neither freed the 150,000 war captives nor apologized to the vanquished***[\[38\]*](https://www.hindustantimes.com/books/this-excerpt-from-a-new-book-demolishes-emperor-ashoka-reputation-as-a-pacifist/story-puxXlUpPsDy4TqELZ3UonN.html#:~:text=If%20Ashoka%20was%20genuinely%20remorseful%2C,ashamed%20of%20their%20crimes%20and).

Modern scholars increasingly view **Aśoka’s post-Kalinga “Dhamma” campaign as a calculated political propaganda tool***[\[39\]*](https://swarajyamag.com/magazine/the-truth-about-ashoka#:~:text=match%20at%20L289%20It%20is,average%20citizen%20or%20official%20of). By broadcasting messages of moral governance (and his personal piety), Aśoka sought to counter his earlier reputation for cruelty and to stabilize a fractious empire[*\[40\]*](https://swarajyamag.com/magazine/the-truth-about-ashoka#:~:text=It%20is%20likely%20that%20Ashoka,average%20citizen%20or%20official%20of). But these edicts were essentially **unilateral proclamations**, often placed on remote frontier rocks or pillars where common folk might not even see them[*\[41\]*](https://swarajyamag.com/magazine/the-truth-about-ashoka#:~:text=politician%2C%20this%20does%20not%20mean,average%20citizen%20or%20official%20of). They served to polish the king’s image in the annals of history more than to directly improve his subjects’ lives. And significantly, **there is no evidence that Aśoka demilitarized his empire after Kalinga** – his administration continued to maintain a large army to secure peace and put down revolts when needed (as later rebellions in Taxila attest). In sum, the romantic narrative of a king’s sudden transformation from violent conqueror to saintly ruler is not strongly supported by contemporary evidence. Aśoka’s own inscriptions present a more complex picture: a ruler who **embraced Buddhist rhetoric and ethics, yet still wielded coercive power and never truly made amends to those he wronged***[\[36\]*](https://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/dhammika/wheel386.html#:~:text=Even%20the%20forest%20people%2C%20who,where%20wrong%20has%20been%20done)*[\[38\]](https://www.hindustantimes.com/books/this-excerpt-from-a-new-book-demolishes-emperor-ashoka-reputation-as-a-pacifist/story-puxXlUpPsDy4TqELZ3UonN.html#:~:text=If%20Ashoka%20was%20genuinely%20remorseful%2C,ashamed%20of%20their%20crimes%20and)*.

## **Aśoka’s Persecution of Rival Sects: The Ājīvika and Jain Massacres**

Contrary to the image of “Dhamma Ashoka” as uniformly tolerant, **ancient texts record that Aśoka later turned violently against rival religious sects**, particularly the Ājīvikas and Jains. The **Aśokavadāna**, a 2nd-century CE Buddhist chronicle, recounts in grim detail how Aśoka’s zeal for Buddhism led to **acts of persecution – essentially religious violence – long after his supposed conversion to non-violence***[\[42\]*](https://swarajyamag.com/magazine/the-truth-about-ashoka#:~:text=The%20Buddhist%20text%2C%20Ashoka,Hindus%20and%20was%20respectful%20towards)*[\[43\]](https://swarajyamag.com/magazine/the-truth-about-ashoka#:~:text=Ashoka%20ordered%20him%20and%20his,surviving%20brother%2C%20the%20Buddhist%20monk)*. In one episode, an image depicting the Buddha in a disrespectful manner (shown bowing to Nirgrantha Jains, according to legend) enraged Aśoka. The king’s response was **draconian**: he ordered the execution of all the Ājīvikas in the city of Pundravardhana (North Bengal). This resulted in **18,000 Ājīvika followers put to death in a single massacre***[\[44\]*](https://swarajyamag.com/magazine/the-truth-about-ashoka#:~:text=Brahmins.%20The%20Ashoka,would%20not%20be%20the%20last) – an act which, if true, stands as **the earliest recorded religious genocide in Indian history***[\[45\]*](https://swarajyamag.com/magazine/the-truth-about-ashoka#:~:text=match%20at%20L302%20Brahmins,would%20not%20be%20the%20last). The Aśokavadāna further claims Aśoka had a Jain heretic and his entire family burnt alive for an alleged slight, and then **placed a bounty of one gold coin on the head of every Jain monk***[\[43\]*](https://swarajyamag.com/magazine/the-truth-about-ashoka#:~:text=Ashoka%20ordered%20him%20and%20his,surviving%20brother%2C%20the%20Buddhist%20monk). Thousands of Jains were decapitated by mercenaries seeking reward. The bloodletting purportedly ceased only when Aśoka’s own brother **Vitaśoka**, who had become a Buddhist monk, was mistaken for a Jain and killed – a shock that jolted Aśoka into remorse over this fanatical purge[*\[46\]*](https://swarajyamag.com/magazine/the-truth-about-ashoka#:~:text=exchange%20for%20every%20decapitated%20head,surviving%20brother%2C%20the%20Buddhist%20monk)*[\[47\]](https://swarajyamag.com/magazine/the-truth-about-ashoka#:~:text=match%20at%20L313%20Vitashoka%20,accuse%20of%20insulting%20their%20religion)*.

These accounts undoubtedly contain hyperbole (even ancient Buddhist writers might have embellished Aśoka’s misdeeds as a moral lesson). Some historians argue such stories might have been later insertions by “fundamentalist” Buddhist authors to exemplify the dangers of insulting the Dharma[*\[48\]*](https://swarajyamag.com/magazine/the-truth-about-ashoka#:~:text=match%20at%20L317%20Supporters%20of,inscriptions%20used%20to%20praise%20Ashoka). Regardless, the fact that **Buddhist sources themselves preserved these legends of Aśoka’s intolerance** is revealing. It suggests that generations closer to Aśoka did *not* see him as a flawlessly gentle ruler, but acknowledged a darker side to his religious rule. As Sanyal wryly notes, the tale of Aśoka’s Jain massacre has “frightening parallels with modern-day fundamentalists who kill cartoonists for perceived insults to their religion”[*\[47\]*](https://swarajyamag.com/magazine/the-truth-about-ashoka#:~:text=match%20at%20L313%20Vitashoka%20,accuse%20of%20insulting%20their%20religion).

At the very least, **Aśoka did not shy from suppressing dissenting sects**. We know from inscriptions that he **outlawed the schismatic Mahīśāsaka and other Buddhist sects** (as per his Pillar Edict VII), showing less than complete pluralism even within Buddhism. And significantly, **his own grandson Sampadi (Samprati)** is said in Jain tradition to have converted to Jainism and built Jain temples in contravention of Aśoka’s Buddhist-centric policies – implying a reaction against Aśoka’s favoritism. In sum, the **post-Kalinga Aśoka was not a secular pacifist by modern standards**. He was a complex figure: an emperor who genuinely espoused Buddhist morality and did much to propagate it, yet who also **leveraged state power to enforce a version of Dharma and at times brutally silenced competing ideologies***[\[49\]*](https://swarajyamag.com/magazine/the-truth-about-ashoka#:~:text=The%20Buddhist%20text%2C%20Ashoka,Hindus%20and%20was%20respectful%20towards)*[\[43\]](https://swarajyamag.com/magazine/the-truth-about-ashoka#:~:text=Ashoka%20ordered%20him%20and%20his,surviving%20brother%2C%20the%20Buddhist%20monk)*. This nuanced reality undermines the oversimplified textbook image of “Aśoka the Great, the peace-loving monarch.”

## **Kharavela of Kalinga and the Reclamation of Heritage**

If Kalinga’s subjugation was the zenith of Aśoka’s military career, **Kalinga’s later revenge came under King Kharavela**, a century after Aśoka. Kharavela (c. 2nd century BCE) was the formidable monarch of Kalinga who not only restored his kingdom’s glory but also **openly repudiated Aśoka’s legacy**. The **Hathigumpha Inscription** at Udayagiri – Kharavela’s own words etched in stone – provides a fascinating coda to the Mauryan saga. In his 8th regnal year (around 185 BCE), **Kharavela marched north and attacked Magadha**, by then ruled by the last Mauryan or early Śuṅga king. He boasts of **“sacking the city of Pataliputra”** (the Mauryan capital) and forcing **“King Bahasatimita”** (identified by historians as Brihadratha, the last Maurya, or perhaps Pushyamitra Śuṅga) to bow in submission[*\[50\]*](https://swarajyamag.com/magazine/the-truth-about-ashoka#:~:text=Kharavela%20realised%20that%20the%20old,of%20north%20and%20central%20India)*[\[51\]](https://swarajyamag.com/magazine/the-truth-about-ashoka#:~:text=proudly%20that%20he%20brought%20back,of%20north%20and%20central%20India)*. Most notably, Kharavela declares that he **“brought back the Jain idols that had been taken away to Pataliputra at the time of the Nanda kings.”***[\[50\]*](https://swarajyamag.com/magazine/the-truth-about-ashoka#:~:text=Kharavela%20realised%20that%20the%20old,of%20north%20and%20central%20India)*[\[52\]](https://swarajyamag.com/magazine/the-truth-about-ashoka#:~:text=he%20returned%20with%20a%20large,With%20the%20prestige%20of)* In one stroke, he avenged both the Nanda-era humiliation of Kalinga and Aśoka’s Kalinga war. The idol in question was likely the revered **Jina image** of Kalinga’s ancient cult, which a Nanda conqueror had stolen generations earlier[*\[5\]*](https://jainworld.com/literature/jain-history/historical-role-of-jainism/#:~:text=Jainism%20appears%20to%20have%20been,was%20the%20follower%20of%20Jainism). By recovering and reinstalling it, **Kharavela reclaimed Kalinga’s cultural heritage and Jain religious pride** that had been trampled by Magadhan imperialism[*\[50\]*](https://swarajyamag.com/magazine/the-truth-about-ashoka#:~:text=Kharavela%20realised%20that%20the%20old,of%20north%20and%20central%20India).

The placement of Kharavela’s inscription is telling: he carved it in a cavern on Udayagiri Hill *directly facing* the hill of Dhauli, where Aśoka’s edicts were carved[*\[53\]*](https://swarajyamag.com/magazine/the-truth-about-ashoka#:~:text=match%20at%20L468%20view%29,the%20end%20of%20Mauryan%20rule). Standing at Hathigumpha, one can literally look out toward Aśoka’s rock edict site at Dhauli across the plain[*\[53\]*](https://swarajyamag.com/magazine/the-truth-about-ashoka#:~:text=match%20at%20L468%20view%29,the%20end%20of%20Mauryan%20rule)*[\[54\]](https://swarajyamag.com/magazine/the-truth-about-ashoka#:~:text=earlier%20and%20would%20have%20been,caused%20the%20end%20of%20Mauryan)*. This is **no coincidence** – it was a bold statement. As Sanyal vividly puts it, **Kharavela positioned his record “as if to tell Ashoka that he, Kharavela of Kalinga, had sacked Pataliputra and caused the end of Mauryan rule.”***[\[53\]*](https://swarajyamag.com/magazine/the-truth-about-ashoka#:~:text=match%20at%20L468%20view%29,the%20end%20of%20Mauryan%20rule)*[\[55\]](https://swarajyamag.com/magazine/the-truth-about-ashoka#:~:text=Udayagiri%20hill%2C%20now%20a%20suburb,the%20end%20of%20Mauryan%20rule)* The people of Kalinga had neither forgotten nor forgiven Aśoka’s invasion. Only three generations had passed since “Ashoka’s brutal invasion” of their land, a trauma **“still fresh in Odia memory”** when Kharavela rose[*\[56\]*](https://swarajyamag.com/magazine/the-truth-about-ashoka#:~:text=Remember%20that%20Ashoka%E2%80%99s%20brutal%20invasion,had%20his%20inscriptions%20placed%20directly). Kharavela’s triumph over the Magadhan dynasty – and the retrieval of the sacred image – was thus deliberately commemorated as **Kalinga’s revenge**. He even extended his conquests far and wide (his inscription claims victories over the Greeks/Yavanas, the Śuṅga-controlled Magadha, the Sātavāhanas of the Deccan, and the Dravidian Pāṇḍyas) and performed the **aśvamedha (horse sacrifice)** to assert himself as a Chakravartin (universal emperor)[*\[57\]*](https://swarajyamag.com/magazine/the-truth-about-ashoka#:~:text=Kharavela%E2%80%99s%20inscriptions%20suggest%20that%20he,veiwpoint%20over%20the%20coastal%20perspective)*[\[58\]](https://swarajyamag.com/magazine/the-truth-about-ashoka#:~:text=south,Despite%20these%20achievements)*. In Indian textbooks, Aśoka often occupies center stage while **Kharavela is scarcely mentioned**, yet in Kalinga’s history Kharavela stands tall as the great liberator who reversed Aśoka’s legacy[*\[59\]*](https://swarajyamag.com/magazine/the-truth-about-ashoka#:~:text=match%20at%20L493%20Kharavela%20is,veiwpoint%20over%20the%20coastal%20perspective)*[\[60\]](https://swarajyamag.com/magazine/the-truth-about-ashoka#:~:text=Kharavela%20is%20almost%20never%20mentioned,veiwpoint%20over%20the%20coastal%20perspective)*.

Importantly, Kharavela was a **devout Jain (referred to as a follower of the arihants)**, and he patronized Jain monks with cave dwellings and endowments in Udayagiri-Khandagiri[*\[61\]*](https://swarajyamag.com/magazine/the-truth-about-ashoka#:~:text=Kharavela%20realised%20that%20the%20old,that%20he%20made%20King%20Bahasatimita). His reign underscores that **Jainism remained robust in eastern India** even after decades of Buddhist dominance. In Kalinga and elsewhere, Jain communities likely saw Aśoka’s Buddhist state as partial to their rival; Kharavela’s victories would have been seen as a restoration of **pluralism and Jain honor**. And indeed, after the Mauryans, we see a **broad religious resurgence of non-Buddhist traditions** across India.

## **Aftermath: Shunga Reaction and the Rise of the Nāth Yogis**

Aśoka’s death in 232 BCE was followed by the rapid unraveling of the Mauryan Empire[*\[62\]*](https://swarajyamag.com/magazine/the-truth-about-ashoka#:~:text=match%20at%20L325%20believe%20that,western%20territories%20that%20had%20been). Within 50 years, the last Mauryan was killed (185 BCE) by his Brahmin general **Pushyamitra Śuṅga**, who founded the Śuṅga dynasty. The **Śuṅgas (185–73 BCE)** reasserted Brahmanical rule in Magadha; later Buddhist texts accuse Pushyamitra of persecuting Buddhists (accounts in the *Divyāvadāna* claim he destroyed monasteries and slew monks), though the historicity of large-scale persecutions is debated. What is clear is that state patronage of Buddhism waned – Pushyamitra **revived Vedic sacrifices** and royal patronage shifted back to orthodox deities. Buddhism, without imperial sponsorship, **lost its political stronghold**. In different regions, it survived under Indo-Greek, Śaka, and Kuṣāṇa kings (many of whom supported Buddhism), and later under the Gupta empire it even enjoyed a renaissance. But by the early medieval era (c. 7th–12th centuries CE), Buddhism in India fell into steep decline due to a combination of factors: loss of patronage, integration into a resurgent Hindu framework, competition from devotional (bhakti) movements, and eventually the destructive impact of Islamic invasions on monastic universities like Nālandā (c. 1200 CE).

One significant development in this post-Mauryan religious landscape was the **emergence of the Nāth** yogī **tradition**, which can be seen as both a continuation of and reaction to the earlier Śramaṇa currents. The **Nāth Sampradāya** (yogic sect of **Matsyendra Nāth, Gorakṣa Nāth**, and others) crystallized in the **medieval period (c. 10th–12th century CE)***[\[63\]*](https://brill.com/display/book/9789004689381/BP000002.xml?language=en&srsltid=AfmBOoqm49-0wFFLKr86hW08E70HnHnsOpIiePUeFLntjsTRjnfyfkXc#:~:text=Brill%20brill,the%20tenth%20or%20eleventh%20century), but drew upon much older ascetic and tantric streams in both Hinduism and Buddhism. The Nāth yogis revered **Lord Śiva as Ādināth (the “Original Lord”)** and traced their lineage to him, sometimes identifying Ādināth with **Dattātreya** or even with **Ṛṣabhadeva (Adinatha)** – figures that bridge Vedic, Puranic, and Jain lore[*\[64\]*](https://www.indica.today/long-reads/nath-siddhacharyas-and-sabar-tantra/#:~:text=animal%20sacrifices%20used%20to%20happen%2C,mentions%20that%20originally%20there%20were). Interestingly, **many early Nāth gurus were said to be Siddhas (perfected ones) who appear in Tibetan and Indian Buddhist legends**. Medieval lists of **84 Mahāsiddhas** include names like Mina Nātha (Matsyendra), Gorakṣa, Nāgārjuna, etc., some of whom are claimed by Buddhist Tantra as well as by the Nāth Saiva tradition[*\[65\]*](https://www.indica.today/long-reads/nath-siddhacharyas-and-sabar-tantra/#:~:text=Some%20of%20these%20like%20Manibhadra%2C,Charpatinath%2C%20Naganath%2C%20Bhartrinath%2C%20Revannath%2C%20Gahaninath)*[\[66\]](https://www.indica.today/long-reads/nath-siddhacharyas-and-sabar-tantra/#:~:text=of%20Siddhas%20as%20Rahula%2C%20Nagarjuna%2C,Charpatinath%2C%20Naganath%2C%20Bhartrinath%2C%20Revannath%2C%20Gahaninath)*. This indicates a rich **cross-pollination between late Buddhism (Vajrayāna) and early Nāth/Yogic practices**. The Nāth sect was notably **heterodox**, eschewing caste and dogma; its yogis lived austere lives, often as mendicant mystics on society’s margins[*\[67\]*](https://www.indica.today/long-reads/nath-siddhacharyas-and-sabar-tantra/#:~:text=Most%20of%20these%20Naths%20and,borrowed%20heavily%20from%20a%20liberal). They absorbed **influences from Buddhist tantras, Śaiva and Śākta (goddess) worship, and alchemical yoga** techniques[*\[68\]*](https://www.indica.today/long-reads/nath-siddhacharyas-and-sabar-tantra/#:~:text=cremation%20grounds%2C%20or%20leather,Shakta%2C%20Vaishnava%20and%20Buddhist%20texts). In essence, as Buddhism in India waned, **much of its esoteric knowledge and anti-caste, monastic spirit migrated into emerging Hindu yogic orders like the Nāths**. The Nāth Siddha tradition kept alive the flame of non-dual mysticism and rigorous ascetic practice, now under a Saivite idiom, at a time when institutional Buddhism was fading.

Notably, **regional folk memory in eastern India and Nepal holds that many Buddhist sites and teachers “converted” into Nāth/Hindu equivalents** as the tides turned. For example, by the 12th century, the famed Bodh Gayā Mahābodhi temple was taken over by a Śaiva mahant (abbot) – a historical reality that persisted into the 19th century. Such transitions illustrate how **Indian civilization recycled and integrated the Buddhist legacy rather than simply extinguishing it**. The **Nāth Yogis and kindred sects (Sahajiyā Bauls, Siddhacāryas, Tantra practitioners)** can be seen as **carriers of an Indic spiritual continuum** that spans Vedic, Śramaṇa, and medieval Tantric streams. Far from India “losing” the Buddha’s contributions, traditions like the Nāths incorporated them and kept evolving. The Nāths even **venerated the Buddha as an incarnation of Vishnu** in some texts, while in parallel Buddhist Vajrayāna in Tibet absorbed Hindu Śaiva deities – a profound two-way exchange.

By the end of the 1st millennium CE, **Hindu schools of philosophy (Vedanta, Yoga) and bhakti movements had reasserted dominance**, with Buddhism largely absent from the land of its birth. But the churn of centuries had produced a rich synthetic culture. It is this syncretic heritage that modern scholars like J. Sai Deepak and others emphasize – the idea that **India’s civilizational narrative was never a simple Buddhist vs Hindu dichotomy**, but rather a tapestry of interwoven traditions. The **legacy of Aśoka** too must be understood in this nuanced context. While Orientalist historians of the 19th–20th centuries often lionized Aśoka as a uniquely enlightened monarch (implicitly contrasting “peaceful Buddhists” with “militant Hindus”), **contemporary Indian scholarship urges a more critical reading**. Aśoka was undoubtedly remarkable for his time in espousing moral governance, but he was also an emperor exercising realpolitik. His story did not end with a utopian victory of non-violence; it was followed by the **restoration of pluralistic and indigenous forces** (from Pushyamitra’s revival of Vedic rites to Kharavela’s Jain restitution to the tantric yogis’ rise) that kept Indian culture dynamic and resilient.

## **Conclusion**

In light of the evidence, Emperor **Aśoka’s legacy** appears far more complex and ambivalent than the conventional textbook image. **Buddhism did become a major force in Magadha well before Aśoka**, under kings like Bimbisara and the Nandas, but it competed with other Śramaṇa traditions and only attained *imperial* preeminence through Aśoka’s patronage[*\[1\]*](https://tathastuics.com/article/dynasties-haryanka-shishunaga-nanda-a-chronological-exploration#:~:text=,for%20the%20establishment%20of%20monasteries)*[\[9\]](https://jainworld.com/literature/jain-history/historical-role-of-jainism/#:~:text=Jainism%20was%20dominant%20in%20Magadha,large%20number%20of%20people%20accepted)*. Aśoka’s **embrace of Buddhism was intertwined with political strategy**, as he sought a unifying ideology after a bloody ascent to power[*\[17\]*](https://www.hindustantimes.com/books/this-excerpt-from-a-new-book-demolishes-emperor-ashoka-reputation-as-a-pacifist/story-puxXlUpPsDy4TqELZ3UonN.html#:~:text=It%20is%20likely%20that%20when,that%20was%20no%20longer%20trusted). The **popular tale of his post-Kalinga conversion and remorse**, long accepted as fact, does not stand up to epigraphic scrutiny – his own inscriptions **lack any apology to the Kalingans and even threaten force against rebels**, revealing a ruler who, while compassionate in rhetoric, never truly renounced the use of violence[*\[36\]*](https://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/dhammika/wheel386.html#:~:text=Even%20the%20forest%20people%2C%20who,where%20wrong%20has%20been%20done)*[\[38\]](https://www.hindustantimes.com/books/this-excerpt-from-a-new-book-demolishes-emperor-ashoka-reputation-as-a-pacifist/story-puxXlUpPsDy4TqELZ3UonN.html#:~:text=If%20Ashoka%20was%20genuinely%20remorseful%2C,ashamed%20of%20their%20crimes%20and)*. Far from being a saintly pacifist, **Aśoka continued to exert a heavy hand**, with Buddhist chronicles accusing him of persecuting rival sects in later years[*\[44\]*](https://swarajyamag.com/magazine/the-truth-about-ashoka#:~:text=Brahmins.%20The%20Ashoka,would%20not%20be%20the%20last)*[\[43\]](https://swarajyamag.com/magazine/the-truth-about-ashoka#:~:text=Ashoka%20ordered%20him%20and%20his,surviving%20brother%2C%20the%20Buddhist%20monk)*. The **aftermath** of Aśoka saw the Mauryan empire fragment and a **reassertion of indigenous religious movements** – from the Brahmin-led Śuṅgas to the Jain king Kharavela who avenged Kalinga[*\[50\]*](https://swarajyamag.com/magazine/the-truth-about-ashoka#:~:text=Kharavela%20realised%20that%20the%20old,of%20north%20and%20central%20India)*[\[54\]](https://swarajyamag.com/magazine/the-truth-about-ashoka#:~:text=earlier%20and%20would%20have%20been,caused%20the%20end%20of%20Mauryan)*, and centuries later, to the Nāth yogis who carried forward India’s ascetic lineage in new forms[*\[68\]*](https://www.indica.today/long-reads/nath-siddhacharyas-and-sabar-tantra/#:~:text=cremation%20grounds%2C%20or%20leather,Shakta%2C%20Vaishnava%20and%20Buddhist%20texts)*[\[64\]](https://www.indica.today/long-reads/nath-siddhacharyas-and-sabar-tantra/#:~:text=animal%20sacrifices%20used%20to%20happen%2C,mentions%20that%20originally%20there%20were)*.

In reevaluating Aśoka with the hindsight of history, we gain a richer understanding of how **politics and piety were often inseparable in ancient India**. Aśoka was indeed a pioneering figure who helped spread the Buddha’s message far and wide – for that he is rightfully celebrated. But he was also a product of his era’s realpolitik, and his Dharma rule was not without coercion. As one historian quips, we must see “Ashoka **the Not So Great**” alongside “Ashoka the Great”[*\[69\]*](https://swarajyamag.com/magazine/the-truth-about-ashoka#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20official%20storyline%2C,The%20main%20evidence%20of)*[\[70\]](https://swarajyamag.com/magazine/the-truth-about-ashoka#:~:text=If%20Ashoka%20was%20genuinely%20remorseful%2C,the%20forest%20tribes%20who%20are)*. By examining the full spectrum of sources – Brahmanical, Buddhist, Jain and others – a more **balanced narrative** emerges, one that honors Aśoka’s contributions while acknowledging the **mythologizing that later surrounded him***[\[27\]*](https://swarajyamag.com/magazine/the-truth-about-ashoka#:~:text=,include%20clear%20threats%20of%20violence)*[\[28\]](https://swarajyamag.com/magazine/the-truth-about-ashoka#:~:text=he%20was%20known%20as%20%E2%80%9CChandashoka%E2%80%9D,discover%20that%20the%20popular%20narrative)*. This nuanced history aligns with the spirit of recent Indian scholars (Bibek Debroy, Sanjeev Sanyal, J. Sai Deepak, et al.), who urge moving past colonial-era caricatures and appreciating the **continuities in India’s civilizational story**. In that story, Aśoka is a luminous chapter – but **not the final one**, as the custodians of Dharma took many forms before and after him. The wheel of time (chakra) kept spinning: Mauryan Buddhism yielded to new guardians of the eternal Dharma, whether Jain kings reclaiming stolen idols, Brahmin dynasts reviving sacrifices, or yogic masters seeking the Divine in cave and cremation ground. **History, viewed deeply, is more complex and compelling than legend – and far more interesting, too**.
