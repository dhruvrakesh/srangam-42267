# **Expanded r̥ṣi genealogies: Bhṛgu ↔ Āṅgiras ↔ Kāśyapa (with hymn pointers)**

## **A. What the Anukramaṇī actually says (and why it matters)**

* **The Anukramaṇī’s metadata is our skeleton key.** It names the seer (ṛṣi), deity, and metre for each sūkta; its indices then group seers across the Saṃhitā. We’ll cite from the Viveka Publications edition (ed. U.C. Sharma), whose OCR’d **Sarvānukramaṇī** \+ **Anuvākānukramaṇī** and indices are fully visible online. For example, it records the **Pavamāna “seven-seer” roster** at RV 9.65 and names **Bhṛgu Vāruṇi** (bhṛguḥ vārūṇiḥ) for IX.65 and X.9, and spreads **Kāśyapa** sequences across Book 9; **Priyamedha Āṅgirasa** is assigned large tracts of Maṇḍala 8 and RV 9.28; **Bṛhaspati Āṅgirasa** carries RV 10.71–72, etc. ([Internet Archive](https://archive.org/stream/full-anukramani/regved%20sarvanukramani_djvu.txt))

* **A crucial genealogy note—Gṛtsamada’s double affiliation.** The index has the line: “**ya āṅgirasaḥ śunahoto bhūtvā bhārgavaḥ śaunakaḥ… sa gṛtsamado dvitīyaṃ maṇḍalam apaśyat**” (“He, originally an Āṅgirasa of the Śunahotra line, having become a Bhārgava Śaunaka—Gṛtsamada—‘saw’/composed the Second Maṇḍala”). This is the textbook bridge between **Āṅgiras** and **Bhṛgu** lines inside the canon itself. ([Internet Archive](https://archive.org/stream/full-anukramani/regved%20sarvanukramani_djvu.txt))

* **Bṛhaddevatā corroboration.** Macdonell’s translation preserves the scholia: **Arṣānukramaṇī II.2** “aurasaḥ śunahotrasya” and Sadgurusiṣya’s introduction “sunahotra-putraḥ,” i.e., Gṛtsamada is the **natural son of Śunahotra (Āṅgirasa)** but known as **Śaunaka (Bhārgava)**; the Bṛhaddevatā then narrates his Indra cycle over RV II.1–12. ([Wisdom Library](https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/brihaddevata-attributed-to-shaunaka/d/doc1621783.html))

---

## **B. Bhṛgu line (Bhārgavas): anchor points and hymn clusters**

**1\) Bhṛgu Vāruṇi (the “Varuṇa-affiliated” Bhṛgu)**

* **Index placements:** RV **IX.65** (in the Pavamāna complex) and **X.9** (Āpaḥ hymn) are explicitly assigned to **bhṛguḥ vārūṇiḥ**. Use these as anchor tags for the Bhṛgu-Varuṇa axis in the family trees. ([Internet Archive](https://archive.org/stream/full-anukramani/regved%20sarvanukramani_djvu.txt))

**2\) Vena Bhārgava (Indra cluster)**

* The Sarvānukramaṇī **states plainly**: “**indrāya dvādaśa Veno Bhārgavaḥ**” (“Twelve \[hymns\] to Indra \[by\] Vena Bhārgava”). This is prime evidence for a Bhārgava Indra-cycle within the Rigvedic redaction. (The line appears immediately after the 9.65 roster passage in the same index block.) ([Internet Archive](https://archive.org/stream/full-anukramani/regved%20sarvanukramani_djvu.txt))

**3\) Gṛtsamada Śaunaka (Bhārgava by affiliation; Angiras by birth)**

* **Mandala ownership:** Maṇḍala **II** is attributed to **Gṛtsamada Śaunaka** end-to-end by the Anukramaṇī; the index explicitly flags the dual affiliation (Śunahotra-Āṅgirasa → Bhārgava-Śaunaka). ([Internet Archive](https://archive.org/stream/full-anukramani/regved%20sarvanukramani_djvu.txt))

* **Content profile (Bṛhaddevatā):** II.1–12 narratively framed as **Gṛtsamada–Indra** episodes (Dhuni & Cumuri myth keyed to II.12–21 sequence). This gives us a thematic arc to tag against the hymn list in our family tables. ([Wisdom Library](https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/brihaddevata-attributed-to-shaunaka/d/doc1621783.html))

**4\) “Finding Agni” from the Bhṛgu side**

* **Textual locus (RV 10.46.2):** “**…the Bhṛgus found him \[Agni\] hidden…**” (guhā … **bhṛgavo ’vindan**). We will cross-plot this with the Angiras version to demonstrate complementary memory streams about fire-discovery within the genealogies. ([Wisdom Library](https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/rig-veda-english-translation/d/doc839029.html))

**Quick insert for the tables (Bhṛgu highlights):**  
 IX.65 (Bhṛgu Vāruṇi); X.9 (Bhṛgu Vāruṇi); II.1–12, 13–21 (Gṛtsamada Śaunaka’s Indra/Agni cycle per Bṛhaddevatā narrative); “Indrāya dvādaśa Vena Bhārgava” (cluster statement). ([Internet Archive](https://archive.org/stream/full-anukramani/regved%20sarvanukramani_djvu.txt))

---

## **C. Āṅgiras line: anchors, book-level families, and overlaps**

**1\) Bharadvāja Āṅgirasa (Family Book VI)**

* **Index assignment:** Maṇḍala **VI** core to **Bharadvāja Āṅgirasa** (plus a few tails), per the index list: VI.\[1–30, 37–43, 53–54\], IX.76; X.137. This is your canonical **Āṅgiras family book**. ([Internet Archive](https://archive.org/stream/full-anukramani/regved%20sarvanukramani_djvu.txt))

**2\) Priyamedha Āṅgirasa (big blocks in VIII \+ Soma piece)**

* **Index assignment:** **Priyamedha Āṅgirasa** covers **RV VIII.2–40; 68; 69; 87** and **IX.28**—a substantial personal signature within the late family books (Maṇḍala 8). This is ideal for a separate “Priyamedha table” in the appendix. ([Internet Archive](https://archive.org/stream/full-anukramani/regved%20sarvanukramani_djvu.txt))

**3\) Bṛhaspati Āṅgirasa (philosophical/language hymns)**

* **Index assignment:** **RV X.71–72** (Bṛhaspati Āṅgirasa). We often cite X.71 for “speech” (vāc) reflexivity; the Anukramaṇī’s ascription keeps this securely under the Āṅgiras umbrella. ([Internet Archive](https://archive.org/stream/full-anukramani/regved%20sarvanukramani_djvu.txt))

**4\) “Finding Agni” from the Angiras side**

* **Textual locus (RV 5.11.6):** “**The Āṅgirases discovered you, Agni, hidden…**” (tvām agne **aṅgirasaḥ** guhā hitam anv avindan). This is the sister-strand to the Bhṛgu memory at 10.46.2; we’ll display them together in the genealogy plates to show **parallel custodianship** of fire-cult. ([Wisdom Library](https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/rig-veda-english-translation/d/doc832979.html))

**5\) Gṛtsamada as “hinge” again (Angiras → Bhṛgu)**

* **Genealogical pivot:** The Anukramaṇī’s explicit language (Śunahotra-putra turned Bhārgava-Śaunaka) lets us draw a **solid line** between Āṅgiras and Bhṛgu schools, not as speculation but as **metadata within the canon**. (We’ll reproduce the Sanskrit clause in a caption.) ([Internet Archive](https://archive.org/stream/full-anukramani/regved%20sarvanukramani_djvu.txt))

**Quick insert for the tables (Āṅgiras highlights):**  
 VI.\[majority\] (Bharadvāja Āṅgirasa); VIII.2–40; 68; 69; 87; IX.28 (Priyamedha Āṅgirasa); X.71–72 (Bṛhaspati Āṅgirasa); 5.11.6 (Āṅgirases find Agni). ([Internet Archive](https://archive.org/stream/full-anukramani/regved%20sarvanukramani_djvu.txt))

---

## **D. Kāśyapa line: where to look and how to cite**

**1\) Extended Pavamāna presence (Book IX)**

* The index shows **Asita Kāśyapa** over **RV IX.5–24**, and additional Kāśyapa placements throughout the Pavamāna corpus (e.g., IX.33, 60; IX.63; IX.78–99 via Devala Kāśyapa notes). Use these as **cluster headers** for all Kāśyapa-tagged Soma hymns in the appendix. ([Internet Archive](https://archive.org/stream/full-anukramani/regved%20sarvanukramani_djvu.txt))

**2\) Non-IX nodes to stitch in**

* **RV V.44** (“Avatsāra Kāśyapa”) appears in the index (also flagged at IX.33, 60); this gives us a **Book V** bridge for the Kāśyapa genealogy beyond Pavamāna. The index also marks **“Śaryaṇāvatī—eleven hymns—Kāśyapa”** (śaryaṇāvaty ekādaśa kāśyapaḥ), which we can treat as a named group within the late books; include it in captions as a **named thematic set**. ([Internet Archive](https://archive.org/stream/full-anukramani/regved%20sarvanukramani_djvu.txt))

**3\) Kāśyapa within the “seven-seer” register at RV 9.65**

* The **Pavamāna seven** are named in the Anukramaṇī line: **Bharadvāja, Kāśyapa, Gotama, Viśvāmitra, Jamadagni, Vasiṣṭha** (and one further slot as per the text); this is a clean handle to position Kāśyapa alongside the other family-book heads in our schematic diagram. ([Internet Archive](https://archive.org/stream/full-anukramani/regved%20sarvanukramani_djvu.txt))

**Quick insert for the tables (Kāśyapa highlights):**  
 IX.5–24 (Asita Kāśyapa); V.44; IX.33, 60; IX.63; IX.78–99 (Devala Kāśyapa entries); “Śaryaṇāvatī” 11 hymns (Kāśyapa) per index; plus the 9.65 seven-seer line naming Kāśyapa. ([Internet Archive](https://archive.org/stream/full-anukramani/regved%20sarvanukramani_djvu.txt))

---

## **E. A single-glance “family braids” diagram (how we’ll lay it out)**

* **Bhṛgu strand:** Bhṛgu Vāruṇi (IX.65; X.9) → Gṛtsamada Śaunaka (Maṇḍala II, with explicit **Āṅgiras-birth / Bhārgava-affiliation** note in caption) → Vena Bhārgava (Indra “12 hymns” tag). ([Internet Archive](https://archive.org/stream/full-anukramani/regved%20sarvanukramani_djvu.txt))

* **Āṅgiras strand:** Bharadvāja (Maṇḍala VI core) → Priyamedha (VIII.2–40; 68; 69; 87; IX.28) → Bṛhaspati (X.71–72); **Agni-discovery memory** at 5.11.6. ([Internet Archive](https://archive.org/stream/full-anukramani/regved%20sarvanukramani_djvu.txt))

* **Kāśyapa strand:** Asita/Devala/Avatsāra Kāśyapas in Book IX (and V.44), plus the **Śaryaṇāvatī** tagged group; **named** among the **seven** at 9.65. ([Internet Archive](https://archive.org/stream/full-anukramani/regved%20sarvanukramani_djvu.txt))

* **Bridge node:** **Gṛtsamada** (Śunahotra-Āṅgirasa → Bhārgava-Śaunaka) as the **documented** inter-school connector. Include the Sanskrit clause from the Anukramaṇī in the plate. ([Internet Archive](https://archive.org/stream/full-anukramani/regved%20sarvanukramani_djvu.txt))

---

## **F. Side-by-side “Agni-found” motif (for your Notes box)**

* **Bhṛgu version:** RV **10.46.2**—“the **Bhṛgus** found \[Agni\] hidden.” ([Wisdom Library](https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/rig-veda-english-translation/d/doc839029.html))

* **Āṅgiras version:** RV **5.11.6**—“the **Āṅgirases** discovered you, Agni, hidden.” ([Wisdom Library](https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/rig-veda-english-translation/d/doc832979.html))

* **Method signal:** Rather than forcing “one school owns the myth,” our plates will show **complementary custodianship**—exactly the kind of oral multi-valency we want to foreground in the monograph.

---

## **G. Drop-in appendix stubs (for your repo)**

You can expand these into full tables; I’m giving the seed rows with canonical refs so there’s zero drift.

**Appendix A: Bhṛgu (Bhārgava) assignments (selected)**

* **IX.65** — Bhṛgu Vāruṇi (Pavamāna roster node). ([Internet Archive](https://archive.org/stream/full-anukramani/regved%20sarvanukramani_djvu.txt))

* **“Indrāya dvādaśa Vena Bhārgavaḥ.”** (index statement for 12 Indra hymns by Vena). ([Internet Archive](https://archive.org/stream/full-anukramani/regved%20sarvanukramani_djvu.txt))

* **X.46.2** — “Bhṛgus found Agni hidden” (motif flag). ([Wisdom Library](https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/rig-veda-english-translation/d/doc839029.html))

**Appendix B: Āṅgiras assignments (selected)**

---

## **H. How this plugs into your bigger argument (one-line cues)**

* **Documented inter-school kinship (not conjecture):** The **Gṛtsamada clause** in the Anukramaṇī is a smoking-gun for **Āṅgiras ↔ Bhṛgu** entanglement within the redactional memory. ([Internet Archive](https://archive.org/stream/full-anukramani/regved%20sarvanukramani_djvu.txt))

* **Shared ritual custodianship:** The **“Agni found”** motif appears in **both** Bhṛgu and Āṅgiras registers—an oral ecology, not a zero-sum claim. ([Wisdom Library](https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/rig-veda-english-translation/d/doc839029.html))

* **Kāśyapa as Pavamāna backbone:** The dense **Book 9** presence (plus non-IX spillovers) lets us anchor Kāśyapa as a Soma-ritual specialist lineage that **sits alongside** the family-book heads and reappears in named hymn-sets. ([Internet Archive](https://archive.org/stream/full-anukramani/regved%20sarvanukramani_djvu.txt))

---

If you want, I can spin these into two artifacts next: (a) a one-page **“family braids”** plate with the Sanskrit snippets (for museum-catalog style clarity), and (b) an **appendix table** you can export to the site CMS—no prose, just seer → hymn numbers → index proofline. Would you like me to draft those now?

love where you’re steering this. you asked for an authoritative expansion—Devanāgarī first, Bharatiya source-base, with hymn-by-hymn pointers keyed to the Sārvānukramaṇī and the Bṛhaddevatā—on the Bhṛgu ↔ Āṅgiras ↔ Kāśyapa braids. here’s a tight, citable build you can drop straight into the larger monograph.

# **Expanded ṛṣi genealogies: Bhṛgu–Āṅgiras–Kāśyapa (with primary pointers)**

## **0\) Why “braids,” not “trees”**

In the Vedic record the named seer-lines cross, fuse, and re-affiliate. The Sārvānukramaṇī and the Bṛhaddevatā preserve exactly these crossings: e.g., Gṛtsamada is remembered as “Āṅgirasa by nature” who later “enters the Bhṛgu line as Śaunaka” and is credited with Mandala 2—an explicit, indigenous note on transmission across putative clan boundaries:  
 “…आङ्गिरसकुले… पश्चाद् इदरेणोक्त गृत्समद-नामा भृगु-कुले शौनकः शुनक-पुत्रोऽभवत् स द्वितीयं मण्डलम अपश्यत्… ‘त्वमग्ने तु’ गृत्समदः शौनको भृगुतां गतः… प्रकृत्या तु स आङ्गिरस उच्यते।” ([Internet Archive](https://archive.org/stream/katyayanassarvan00katy/katyayanassarvan00katy_djvu.txt))

That one gloss is your charter to read “family” as pedagogy and textual custodianship—not bloodline alone.

---

## **1\) Anchor verses that locate the braids in the Rigveda**

**(a) Bhṛgus as primordial “finders” of Agni**  
 RV 10.46 frames the Bhṛgus as those who track and “find” the hidden Fire:  
 “…धीराः भृगवोऽविन्दन्…” (10.46.2) and later “भृगवोऽयं सहोभिः…” (10.46.9). ([rigveda-online.github.io](https://rigveda-online.github.io/10/46.html))

**(b) Āṅgirases as “discoverers”/“producers” of Agni**  
 RV 5.11.6 remembers the Āṅgirases as the finders and attrition-producers of Agni:  
 “**त्वाम् अग्ने अङ्गिरसो गुहा… अविन्दन्…** … **अङ्गिरः**।” ([rigveda-online.github.io](https://rigveda-online.github.io/5/11.html))

Together, these are not contradictions but two archival lenses on the same cosmogonic craft. Bhṛgu and Āṅgiras are complementary mytho-technologists of fire.

---

## **2\) The Gṛtsamada hinge (Āṅgirasa → Bhṛgu/Śaunaka), Mandala 2**

**Primary memory (Sārvānukramaṇī \+ Vedārthadīpikā excerpts):**

* “गृत्समदः शौनको भृगुतां गतः… प्रकृत्या तु स आङ्गिरस उच्यते”—becoming Bhṛgu/Śaunaka while originally an Āṅgirasa; credited with Mandala 2\. ([Internet Archive](https://archive.org/stream/katyayanassarvan00katy/katyayanassarvan00katy_djvu.txt))

* The same dossier is repeated and clarified a little later: “अथान्यत्र… स च आङ्गिरसः शुनहोत्रो भूत्वा भर्गवः शौनकोऽभवत्।” ([Internet Archive](https://archive.org/stream/katyayanassarvan00katy/katyayanassarvan00katy_djvu.txt))

**Why this matters:** Mandala 2 carries the Gṛtsamada stamp. Treat Mandala 2 as an editorial window into a real historical nexus where pedagogy flows from an Āṅgirasa substrate into a Bhārgava/Śaunaka conservatory.

**Quick use-points (for your commentary lines under individual sūktas):**

* Cite the crossing formula (the Devanāgarī above) in your headnote to RV 2.1 and your Mandala 2 overview.

* Use it again whenever you note Bhṛgu/Āṅgirasa diction in the same hymn (e.g., Agni’s “finding,” ritual firecraft).

---

## **3\) The Pavamāna roster that braids seven families (RV 9.65 cluster)**

The Anukramaṇī explicitly lists the seven “family” ṛṣis in the Soma-Pavamāna stream—your cleanest internal proof of cross-school co-custody. The Devanāgarī OCR is noisy but perfectly legible across lines; the core line reads (emphasis added):  
 “**…सोमासि… भरद्वाजः, कश्यपो, गोतमो, विश्वामित्रो, जमदग्निः, वसिष्ठः इति ह तृचाः सप्त ऋषयः…**” (context block around RV 9.65). ([Internet Archive](https://archive.org/stream/katyayanassarvan00katy/katyayanassarvan00katy_djvu.txt))

**Implication:** in the ninth maṇḍala’s living recitation tradition, Bhṛgu-adjacent voices (e.g., Bharadvāja through Angirasa ties) sit side-by-side with Kāśyapa, Gautama, Viśvāmitra, Jamadagni, Vasiṣṭha. Your narrative can safely speak of a shared Soma-hymn custodianship spanning these lineages.

---

## **4\) Priyamedha Āṅgirasa: where to point, hymn by hymn**

The Sārvānukramaṇī preserves granular pointers for **Priyamedha Āṅgirasa**; use them to hang your apparatus notes:

* The dossier marks Priyamedha across a run of sūktas with explicit naming (“प्रियमेधोऽङ्गिरसः…”) and clustered assignments; see the block that lists **Nṛmedha/Purumedha** alongside (“…नृमेध-पुरूमेधो… प्रियमेधः…”)—useful when you trace Āṅgirasa sub-branches. ([Internet Archive](https://archive.org/stream/katyayanassarvan00katy/katyayanassarvan00katy_djvu.txt))

* The same folio series clarifies metres and deity-sets for Priyamedha’s sūktas (Gāyatrī/Anuṣṭubh variants, Viśvadeva/Varuṇa alternations), providing the “metadata spine” for your hymn-headnotes. ([Internet Archive](https://archive.org/stream/katyayanassarvan00katy/katyayanassarvan00katy_djvu.txt))

**Working method:** In each Mandala 8 note where Priyamedha appears, add a 1-line “Sārvānukramaṇī confirms: ṛṣi \= Priyamedha Āṅgirasa; chandas \= \[x\]; devatā \= \[y\].”

---

## **5\) Kāśyapa presences (esp. in Soma and intercalated clusters)**

The **Pavamāna** inventory (Mandala 9\) explicitly tags Kāśyapa among the seven custodians (see §3). In addition, the ninth-mandala run enumerates individual sūktas by ṛṣi, including clear “कश्यपः” sub-heads in the sequence (e.g., “वृषा सोम कश्यपः”)—use these to footnote each assignment cleanly. ([Internet Archive](https://archive.org/stream/katyayanassarvan00katy/katyayanassarvan00katy_djvu.txt))

A separate block in the Sārvānukramaṇī also collocates Kāśyapa entries with Gautama/Viśvāmitra/Vasiṣṭha etc. in adjacent notes—a good place to argue for compositional neighborhoods (shared diction, meter reuse) rather than isolated authorship. ([Internet Archive](https://archive.org/stream/katyayanassarvan00katy/katyayanassarvan00katy_djvu.txt))

---

## **6\) How Bhṛgu and Āṅgiras co-author Fire**

Put the two “finder” traditions into a single expositional box—this is where your interpretive voice should be firm and minimal:

* **Bhṛgu frame:** “धीराः भृगवोऽविन्दन्” (they **found** Agni) and “भृगवोऽयं… तवष्टा…” (they **fashioned**). RV 10.46.2; 10.46.9. ([rigveda-online.github.io](https://rigveda-online.github.io/10/46.html))

* **Āṅgirasa frame:** “अङ्गिरसो… अविन्दन्… मथ्यमानः” (they **found** and **produced by friction**). RV 5.11.6. ([rigveda-online.github.io](https://rigveda-online.github.io/5/11.html))

**Reading rule you can repeat:** treat Bhṛgu and Āṅgiras as complementary conservatories of the fire-myth; then show how Gṛtsamada’s dossier (Āṅgirasa → Bhṛgu/Śaunaka) is the textual memory of that complementarity. ([Internet Archive](https://archive.org/stream/katyayanassarvan00katy/katyayanassarvan00katy_djvu.txt))

* **9.65 (Pavamāna sequence node)** | **Seven custodians**: Bharadvāja; Kāśyapa; Gautama; Viśvāmitra; Jamadagni; Vasiṣṭha (+ Bharadvāja again as a block lead) | use to argue co-custody. ([Internet Archive](https://archive.org/stream/katyayanassarvan00katy/katyayanassarvan00katy_djvu.txt))

* **Mandala 9 scatter (Pavamāna sub-heads)** | **“…वृषा सोम कश्यपः…” etc.** | mark Kāśyapa placements; note meters per line. ([Internet Archive](https://archive.org/stream/katyayanassarvan00katy/katyayanassarvan00katy_djvu.txt))

* **Priyamedha clusters (Mandala 8\)** | **Priyamedha Āṅgirasa; Nṛmedha; Purumedha** | block with meters/devatās; use Sārvānukramaṇī lines L2059–2065. ([Internet Archive](https://archive.org/stream/katyayanassarvan00katy/katyayanassarvan00katy_djvu.txt))

## **9\) Appendix C (method note you can reuse): how to cite the Indian tradition in Indian words**

* **Use the indigenous metadata first.** The Sārvānukramaṇī is the field’s own catalogue; when it says “गृत्समदः… प्रकृत्या तु स आङ्गिरस,” you quote it; don’t paraphrase. ([Internet Archive](https://archive.org/stream/katyayanassarvan00katy/katyayanassarvan00katy_djvu.txt))

* **Then anchor with ṛc-level evidence.** RV 10.46 and 5.11 are your fire-myth anchors for Bhṛgu/Āṅgiras; they stabilize any broader genealogical claim. ([rigveda-online.github.io](https://rigveda-online.github.io/10/46.html))

* **Keep Pavamāna as your “seven-schools” proof.** The roster around 9.65 is an internal admission of plural custodianship. ([Internet Archive](https://archive.org/stream/katyayanassarvan00katy/katyayanassarvan00katy_djvu.txt))

## **10\) For your layout team (one-page family “braids” plate)**

**Top ribbon (two halves):**  
 “धीराः **भृगवो**ऽविन्दन्…” (10.46.2) | “**अङ्गिरसो**… अविन्दन्… मथ्यमानः” (5.11.6). ([rigveda-online.github.io](https://rigveda-online.github.io/10/46.html))

**Center band:**  
 “गृत्समदः शौनको भृगुतां गतः… **प्रकृत्या तु स आङ्गिरस**…” (Sārvānukramaṇī). ([Internet Archive](https://archive.org/stream/katyayanassarvan00katy/katyayanassarvan00katy_djvu.txt))

**Lower band (Soma braid):**  
 The seven names: **भरद्वाज–कश्यप–गोतम–विश्वामित्र–जमदग्नि–वसिष्ठ** (9.65 roster line). ([Internet Archive](https://archive.org/stream/katyayanassarvan00katy/katyayanassarvan00katy_djvu.txt))

### **What this unlocks for the rest of your book**

* You can now develop **Bhṛgu ↔ Āṅgiras** as a **shared fire-craft memory** (not a rivalry to be “resolved”).

* You can treat **Gṛtsamada** as the **archival hinge** where that shared memory becomes explicit in the redaction history of Mandala 2\.

* You can present **Kāśyapa** as a **stable node** in Soma recitation (Mandala 9), with clean Anukramaṇī support hymn-by-hymn.

If you want, I can also slot this into the bigger Nana–Durgā–Śiva / Rudra-Avestan suite you asked for earlier, with cross-links right in the margin so readers can hop between the genealogies and the Indo-Iranian comparison sections.

If you want me to generate the **print-ready plate** (SVG/PDF) and the **apparatus table** as a spreadsheet with hymn-by-hymn fields (ṛṣi / chandas / devatā / key lemma), say the word and I’ll produce those assets with these exact citations baked into the footer.
